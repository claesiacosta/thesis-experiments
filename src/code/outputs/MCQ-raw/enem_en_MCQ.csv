Researchers were able to stimulate the absorption of 
light energy in plants thanks to the use of carbon 
nanotubes. For this, carbon nanotubes 'inserted' into the interior of chloroplasts through a spontaneous assembly, through the membranes of the chloroplasts. Plant pigments absorb light radiation, electrons are 'excited' and move within the chloroplast membranes, and the plant then uses this electrical energy to produce sugars. Carbon nanotubes can absorb wavelengths usually not used by chloroplasts, and researchers had the idea of using them as 'antennas', stimulating the conversion of solar energy by chloroplasts, with increased electron transport.

Carbon nanotubes enhance plant photosynthesis.

Fuse is a protection device against 
overcurrent in circuits. When the current passing 
through this electrical component is higher than its maximum 
nominal current, the fuse burns. In this way, it prevents 
the high current from damaging the circuit's devices. 
Suppose that the electrical circuit shown is powered 
by a voltage source U and that the fuse supports a 
nominal current of 500 mA.

The acetylsalicylic acid, AAS (molar mass equal to 180 g/mol), is synthesized from the reaction of salicylic acid 
(molar mass equal to 138 g/mol) with acetic anhydride, using sulfuric acid as a catalyst, according to the 
chemical equation:

After synthesis, AAS is purified and the final yield is approximately 50%. Due to its pharmacological properties (antipyretic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antithrombotic), AAS is used as a medication in 
the form of tablets, typically employing a mass of 500 mg of this substance.

The Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a disease 
caused by a mutation in a gene located on the 
X chromosome. Researchers studied a family 
in which monozygotic twins were carriers of a 
recessive mutant allele for this gene (heterozygous). 
The interesting fact is that one of the twins had 
the phenotype related to the mutant allele, that is, DMD, 
while her sister had a normal phenotype.

To comply with current environmental standards, construction companies need to anticipate in their works the issue of using materials in order to minimize the impacts caused on site. Among these materials is the so-called concregram or pisogram, which is a type of coating composed of concrete pieces with empty areas filled with grass soil. The figures show these two forms of concrete flooring.

Some types of desalination plants use the process of 
reverse osmosis to obtain drinking water from 
saltwater. In this method, a container is used 
containing two compartments separated by a 
semipermeable membrane: in one of them saltwater is placed 
and in the other drinking water is collected. The application 
of mechanical pressure on the system causes the water to flow from one 
compartment to the other. The movement of water molecules 
through the membrane is controlled by osmotic pressure and the applied mechanical pressure.

To demonstrate the process of transforming mechanical energy into electrical energy, a student builds a small generator using:

• a copper wire with diameter D wound in N circular turns of area A;

• two magnets that create a uniform magnetic field of intensity B in the space between them; and

• a gear system that allows him to rotate the turns around an axis with a frequency f.

When the generator is operational, the student obtained a maximum voltage V and a short-circuit current i.","{

The paper chromatography is a separation method based on the differential migration of components 
of a mixture between two immiscible phases. The sample components are separated between the stationary phase and 
the mobile phase moving on the paper. The stationary phase consists of practically pure cellulose, which can absorb 
up to 22% of water. It is the absorbed water that functions as a liquid stationary phase and interacts with the mobile phase, 
also liquid (liquid-liquid partition). Components capable of forming stronger intermolecular interactions 
with the stationary phase migrate more slowly.

A mixture of hexane with 5% (v/v) acetone was used as the mobile phase in the separation of components 
from a plant extract obtained from peppers. Consider that this extract contains the substances represented.

The retina is a light-sensitive tissue, located in the back of the eye, where the image formation process occurs. In this tissue, several specific types of cells are found. One of these cell types is the cones, which convert different wavelengths of visible light into electrical signals, which are transmitted by the optic nerve to the brain.

In a cafeteria, the best-selling products in the summer are juices 
prepared with fruit pulp. One of the most sold juices is the strawberry with acerola, which is prepared with <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mfrac><mn>2</mn><mn>3</mn></mfrac></math> of strawberry pulp and <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>3</mn></mfrac></math> of acerola pulp.

For the merchant, the pulps are sold in 
packagings of equal volume. Currently, the packaging 
of strawberry pulp costs R$ 18.00 and acerola, 
R$ 14.70. However, there is a forecasted increase in the price 
of the acerola pulp packaging next month, 
increasing to R$ 15.30.

In order not to increase the price of the juice, the merchant 
negotiated with the supplier a reduction in the price of 
the strawberry pulp packaging.

The English physiologist Archibald Vivian Hill proposed, in his studies, that the contraction speed v of a muscle when subjected to a weight p is given by the equation <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mfenced><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>a</mi></mrow></mfenced><mfenced><mrow><mi>v</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow></mfenced><mo>=</mo><mi>K</mi></math>, with <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mi>a</mi></math>, <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mi>b</mi></math>, and <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mi>K</mi></math> constants.

A physiotherapist, aiming to maximize the beneficial effect of the exercises he would recommend to one of his patients, wanted to study this equation and classified it as follows:


The physiotherapist analyzed the dependence between v and p in the Hill equation and classified it according to its geometric representation on the Cartesian plane, using the coordinate pair (p; v). Assume that <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mi>K</mi><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>0</mn></math>.

For a season of Formula 1 races, the fuel tank capacity of each car became 100 kg of gasoline. A team chose to use gasoline with a density of 750 grams per liter, starting the race with a full tank. At the first refueling stop, a car from this team showed a record on its onboard computer indicating the consumption of four tenths of the gasoline originally in the tank. To minimize the weight of this car and ensure the end of the race, the support team refueled the car with one third of what was left in the tank upon arrival at the refueling station.

The solar energy will supply part of the energy demand 
of the campus of a Brazilian university. The installation of 
solar panels in the parking areas and on the roof 
of the pediatric hospital will be used in the university facilities 
and also connected to the grid of the electricity distribution company.

The project includes 100 m² of solar panels that will be 
installed in the parking areas, producing electrical energy 
and providing shade for the cars. About the pediatric hospital 
approximately 300 m² of panels will be installed, with 100 m² for generating electrical energy used on the 
campus, and 200 m² for thermal energy generation, producing 
water heating used in the hospital boilers.

Suppose that each square meter of solar panel 
for electrical energy generates a saving of 1 kWh per day 
and each square meter producing thermal energy allows 
saving 0.7 kWh per day for the university. In 
a second phase of the project, the area 
covered by the solar panels generating 
electrical energy will be increased by 75%. In this phase, the area 
of coverage with panels for thermal energy generation should also be expanded.

In this thermometer model, the black filaments 
record the minimum and maximum temperatures of the previous day 
and the gray filaments record the current room temperature, 
that is, at the moment of reading the thermometer. 

That's why it has two columns. In the left one, the 
numbers are in ascending order, from top to bottom, 
from -30 ºC to 50 ºC. In the right column, the numbers 
are ordered in ascending order, from bottom to top, 
from -30 ºC to 50 ºC.

The reading is done as follows:
•  the minimum temperature is indicated by the lower level 
of the black filament in the left column;

•  the maximum temperature is indicated by the lower level 
of the black filament in the right column;

•  the current temperature is indicated by the upper level 
of the gray filaments in both columns.

The Tupi language in Brazil

300 years ago, living in the village of São Paulo de Piratininga (dried fish, in Tupi) was almost synonymous with speaking the Indian language. Out of every five inhabitants of the city, only two knew Portuguese. Therefore, in 1698, the governor of the province, Artur de Sá e Meneses, begged Portugal to only send priests who knew 'the general language of the Indians', because 'those people do not explain themselves in any other language'.

Derived from the dialect of São Vicente, the Tupi of São Paulo developed and spread in the 17th century, thanks to the geographical isolation of the city and the unchristian activity of the Paulista mamelucos: the bandeiras, expeditions to the backlands in search of Indian slaves. Many bandeirantes did not even speak Portuguese or expressed themselves poorly. Domingos Jorge Velho, the Paulista who destroyed the Quilombo dos Palmares in 1694, was described by the bishop of Pernambuco as 'a barbarian who doesn't even know how to speak'. In their wanderings, these people baptized places like Avanhandava (place where the Indian runs), Pindamonhangaba (place to make a fishing hook), and Itu (waterfall). And ended up inventing a new language.
'The slaves of the bandeirantes came from more than 100 different tribes,' says historian and anthropologist John Monteiro, from the State University of Campinas. 'This changed the Paulista Tupi, which, in addition to the influence of Portuguese, also received words from other languages.' The result of the mixture became known as the general language of the south, a kind of simplified Tupi.

The reveler

When Admiral Cabral
Set foot in Brazil
The guardian angel of the Indians
Was strolling in Paris.
When he returned from his trip
The Dutchman was already here.
The angel breathes happily:
""It's okay, these are good people,
I'll air out again.""
The angel crossed the bar,
Says goodbye to Pernambuco,
Makes noise, hubbub,
Just like the zeppelin
But a wind hit the angel,
He lost his memory...
And never came back.

20,"LANGUAGES, CODES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES",2017,"One night in 67, by Renato Terra and Ricardo Calil. 
Publisher Planeta, 296 pages.

But it was a night, that Saturday night of October 21, 1967, that stopped our country. Stopped to watch the final of the III Record Festival, when a 24-year-old young man named Eduardo Lobo, Edu Lobo, left the Paramount Theater in São Paulo after winning the festival's top prize with Ponteio, which he sang accompanied by the charming and beginner Marília Medalha.

It was that night that Chico Buarque sang his Roda viva alongside MPB-4 of Magro, the arranger. That Caetano Veloso shone singing Alegria, alegria with the audience to the sound of the Beat Boys' guitars, that Gilberto Gil presented the tropicalist Domingo no parque with the Mutantes.

That night that ended up becoming a movie, in 2010, in the hands of Renato Terra and Ricardo Calil, has now become a book. The book being launched now is the story of that night, expanded and in a state that in journalistic jargon we call raw material. Those who saw the movie will delight in the stories - and some gossip - that each one has to tell, now without the necessary cuts that a movie demands. And those who did not see the movie have before them a book of stories, thinking well, of History.

Declaration of love

This is a confession of love: I love the Portuguese language. 
It is not easy. It is not malleable. [...] The Portuguese language is 
a real challenge for those who write. Especially for 
those who write, taking off the first layer of superficiality from things and people. 

Sometimes it reacts to a more complicated thought. Sometimes it is scared by the unpredictable 
of a sentence. I like to handle it - as I liked to be mounted on a horse and guide it by the reins, sometimes 
at a gallop. I wanted the Portuguese language to reach 
its maximum in my hands. And this desire is shared by all who write. A Camões and others alike were not enough 
to give us forever an inheritance of a language already made. 
All of us who write are making something that gives life to the grave of thought.

We have these difficulties. But I did not speak 
of the enchantment of dealing with a language that was not 
profound. What I inherited is not enough for me. 

If I were mute and also could not write, and 
they asked me which language I wanted to belong to, I would say: 
English, which is precise and beautiful. But, as I was not born mute and 
could write, it became absolutely clear to me 
that what I really wanted was to write in Portuguese. I even 
wished I had not learned other languages: just so that my 
approach to Portuguese would be virgin and clear.

And here, before continuing this show, it is necessary to make a warning to everyone. At this moment, we find it essential that everyone takes a defined position. Without each one taking a defined position, we cannot continue. It is essential that everyone takes a position, whether to the left or to the right. We even admit that some may take a neutral position, with their arms crossed. But it is necessary that each one, once they have taken their position, stays in it! Because otherwise, companions, the theater chairs creak a lot and no one hears anything.

Weekend at the park

Look at my people in the favelas and you will realize
From here I see a brand new car
Fully equipped and the old man driving
With his children by his side they are going to the park
Euphoric electronic toys
Automatically I imagine
The kids from the area how they are
Probably running around here and there
Playing barefoot soccer in the dirt streets
Yeah, they play the way they can
[...]
Look at that club, how cool
Look at that court, look at that field, look
Look how many people
There's an ice cream shop, cinema, hot pool
[...]
Here I don't see any sports club
No incentive for the kids to attend
The investment in leisure is very scarce
The community center is a failure

On that morning of clear sky and light air, due to the torrential rain of the previous night, I went out for a walk with the sun still hidden to take notice of the first movements of life in the countryside. It didn't take long and the intense smell of coffee brewed by Dona Linda invaded my nostrils and made hunger awaken from that lethargic state derived from the long night of sleep. I put my hands in the water that ran through the bamboo spout and the cold contact gave me goosebumps. But I went on and cupped my hands to my face. With the impact, I stepped back and momentarily lost my breath, but the awakening was immediate. Already awake, I entered the kitchen in search of quenching my hunger and getting close to the warmth of the wood stove. That's when I noticed the slender and discreet figure of a lady accompanied by a boy who seemed to be about five years old already seated at the end of the table in an intimate chat with the lady of the house. After a vigorous 'Good morning!', a warm handshake in the customary introductions, I learned that Dona Flor de Maio was taking her son Adão for treatment of the wounds that were popping up on his body, causing small pustules with reddish edges.","{

 Zé Araújo began to sing in a sad tone, telling 
to the curious who began to arrive that a woman 
had knelt at the feet of the holy cross and sworn in 
the name of Jesus a great love, but swore and did not fulfill, 
pretended and deceived me, you lied to me, you sinned against God, the heart has reasons that reason itself 
does not know, makes promises and vows, then forgets.

  The caboclo was sad and inspired. After this 
song that gave Neusa goosebumps, he followed with 
a waltz even more spirited, full of difficult words, 
but beautiful as only the serene drop. It was the story of a 
charming doll seen in a crystal showcase on the 
majestic pedestal. Zé Araújo closed his eyes and let 
out his voice:

Her hair had the color/ Of the sun radiating/ 
Fulvous rays of love./ Her eyes were circunvagos/
Of the blue romanticism of lakes/ Lyrical hands, some 
divine arms,/ A white body like no other/ And the feet 
very small./ Finally I saw in this doll/ A perfect 
Venus.

Contranarciso

in me 
I see the other
and another
and another
finally dozens
trains passing
wagons full of people
hundreds
the other
that is in me
is you
you
and you
just as
I am in you
I am in him
in us
and only when
we are in us
we are at peace
even if we are alone

RAUSCHENBERG, R. Bed. Oil and pencil on pillow, quilt and sheet on wooden support.

TEXT II

In the summer of 1954, the artist Robert Rauschenberg 
(b.1925) coined the term combine to refer to his 
new works that had aspects of both painting and 
sculpture.

In 1958, Bed was selected to be included in an 
exhibition of young American and Italian artists 
at the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy.
However, the festival organizers refused to 
show the work and removed it to a storage.

While the art world debated the innovation of 
hanging a bed on a wall, Rauschenberg 
considered his work 'one of the most welcoming 
paintings I've ever painted, but I've always been 
afraid someone would want to crawl into it'.

In participation sport or popular sport, the manifestation occurs in the principle of ludic pleasure, which has as its purpose the social well-being of its practitioners. It is closely associated with leisure and free time and occurs in spaces not committed to time and outside the obligations of daily life. It aims at relaxation, fun, personal development and relationship with people. It can be stated that participation sport, being the social dimension of sport most interrelated with democratic paths, balances the framework of inequalities of sports opportunities found in the performance sport dimension. While performance sport only allows success to talents or those who had conditions, participation sport favors pleasure to all who wish to take part.","{

João/Zero (Wagner Moura) is a brilliant scientist, but 
unhappy because 20 years ago he was publicly humiliated 
during a party and lost Helena (Alinne Moraes), an 
old and eternal passion. One day, an experiment with 
one of his inventions allows him to travel in 
time, returning to that time and being able to interfere 
in his destiny. But when he returns, he finds out that 
his life has completely changed and now he needs to find a way to change that story, even if he has to 
return to the past again. Will he be able to 
get things right?

46,HUMANITIES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2017,"
If, then, for the things we do there is an end 
that we desire for its own sake and everything else is desired 
in the interest of that end; evidently such an end will be the good, 
or rather, the supreme good. But will not knowledge, 
perhaps, have great influence on this life? If so, 
let us strive to determine, even if only in general terms, what it is and from which of the sciences or 
faculties it constitutes the object. No one will doubt that 
its study belongs to the most prestigious art and that 
more truly can be called the master art. 
Now, politics shows to be of this nature, for it is she who 
determines which sciences should be studied 
in a State, which are those that each citizen should 
learn, and to what extent; and we see that even the most esteemed faculties, such as strategy, economics and 
rhetoric, are subject to it. Now, as politics uses 
the other sciences and, on the other hand, legislates on what 
we should and should not do, the purpose of this 
science must encompass those of the others, so that this 
purpose will be the human good.

This is about the progressive loss of productivity of entire biomes, affecting very expressive portions of the sub-humid and semi-arid domains in all hot regions of the world. It is in these ecologically transitional areas that the pressure on biomass is strongly felt, due to the removal of forest cover, overgrazing, and uncontrolled mining activities, triggering an acute environmental degradation scenario, reflected by the inability to support the development of plant species, whether a natural forest or agricultural plantations.

A society is a more or less self-sufficient association of people who in their mutual relations recognize certain rules of conduct as obligatory and who, most of the time, act accordingly. A society is well-ordered not only when it is planned to promote the well-being of its members, but also when it is effectively regulated by a public conception of justice. That is, it is a society in which everyone accepts, and knows that others accept, the same principle of justice.

The representation of Democritus is similar to that of Anaxagoras, in that an infinitely multiple is the origin; but in him the determination of the fundamental principles appears in such a way that it contains what for what it was formed is not, absolutely, the simple aspect for itself. For example, particles of flesh and gold would be principles that, through their concentration, form what appears as a figure.

A conversation of such a nature transforms the listener; Socrates' contact paralyzes and embarrasses; leads to reflect on oneself, to give attention an unusual direction: the temperamental, like Alcibiades, know that they will find with him all the good of which they are capable, but they flee because they fear this powerful influence, which leads them to blame themselves. It is especially to these young people, many almost children, that he tries to give his guidance.

There are, as is known, two candidates for the presidency, 
Mr. Eduardo Gomes and Eurico Dutra, and a third, 
Mr. Getúlio Vargas, who must be a candidate of some 
hidden political group, but is also the popular candidate. 
Because there are two “we want”: the “we want” of those 
who want to see if they continue in their positions and the popular “we want”... After all, what is Mr. Getúlio Vargas? 
Is he a fascist? Is he a communist? Is he an atheist? Is he a Christian? Does he want to leave? 
Does he want to stay? However, the people seem to like him 
precisely because he is “in the style of the house”.

The popular institute, according to the examination of reason, made the figure of the ensign Xavier the main one among the conspirators, and placed his partners at half the ration of glory. Certainly deserve our esteem those others; they were patriots. But the one who offered to bear the sinners of Israel, the one who cried with joy when he saw the death penalty of his companions commuted, a penalty that was only going to be executed on him, the hanged one, the quartered one, the beheaded one, he has to receive the prize in proportion to the martyrdom, and win for all, since he paid for all.

The concept of democracy, in Habermas' thought, is built from a procedural dimension based on discourse and deliberation. Democratic legitimacy requires that the process of political decision-making occurs from a broad public discussion, only then deciding. Thus, the deliberative character corresponds to a collective process of weighing and analysis, permeated by discourse, which precedes the decision.

A person finds himself forced by necessity to borrow money. He knows very well that he will not be able to pay, but also sees that they will not lend him anything if he does not promise firmly to pay within a specified period. Feels tempted to make the promise; but still has enough conscience to ask himself: is it not forbidden and contrary to duty to get out of trouble in this way? Assuming that he decides to do so, his maxim of action would be: when I think I am in financial trouble, I will borrow it and promise to pay it back, although I know that this will never happen.

The 8.8 Richter scale earthquake that hit the west coast of Chile in February caused significant changes in the region's map. According to a preliminary analysis, the entire city of Concepción shifted at least three meters to the west. Buenos Aires moved about 2.5 centimeters to the west, while Santiago, closer to the event location, shifted almost 30 centimeters to the west-southwest. The cities of Valparaíso, in Chile, and Mendoza, in Argentina, also had their positions significantly altered (13.4 centimeters and 8.8 centimeters, respectively).

The vast majority of democratic Western countries 
have adopted the Constitutional Court as a mechanism 
to control the other powers. The inclusion of the Courts 
in the political scenario implied changes in the calculation 
for the implementation of public policies. The government, 
besides negotiating its political plan with the Parliament, 
had to worry about not infringing the Constitution. 
This new institutional architecture 
has led to the development of a political environment that enabled 
the Judiciary's participation in decision-making processes.

By destroying a landscape of twisted trunk trees, leaves and rough shrubs on acidic soils, often laterized or taken over by the bizarre forms of termite mounds, this modernization linearizes and apparently does not allow questioning the modernist pretension that form must follow function.

But it was above all wool that buyers, coming 
from Flanders or Italy, sought everywhere. 
To satisfy them, the breeds were improved through 
the progressive increase in their dimensions. This 
growth continued throughout the thirteenth century, and 
the abbeys of the Cistercian Order, where the most rational methods of cattle breeding were used, 
certainly played a decisive role in this improvement.

The largest consumers of logistics infrastructure for export in Brazil are bulk products, among which stand out iron ore, oil and its derivatives, and soybeans, which, due to their low added value, and being moved in large volumes, require large-scale and low-cost infrastructure. In the case of soybeans, the infrastructure leaves much to be desired, resulting in huge queues of ships, trucks, and trains, which, as they remain idle in the queues for much of the time, have their costs increased, heavily burdening the exporter, affecting their profit margin and threatening our international competitiveness.

The diversity of activities related to the tertiary sector reinforces the more general trend of deindustrialization in many developed countries without, however, losing control of the economy. This change implies a new international division of labor, which is no longer supported by the clear sectoral segmentation of economic activities.

The accelerated wear and tear will always exist if the farmer does not take proper care to combat the causes, related to various processes, such as: chemical impoverishment and leaching caused by the exhaustion caused by crops and by the vertical washing of nutrients from the water that infiltrates the soil, as well as by the removal of nutritious elements with the crops. The nutrients removed, when not replaced, are commonly replaced by toxic elements, such as, for example, aluminum.

We seek to demonstrate that development can be seen as a process of expanding real freedoms that people enjoy. The focus on human freedoms contrasts with more restrictive views of development, such as those that identify development with growth of the Gross National Product, or industrialization. The growth of the GNP can be very important as a means of expanding freedoms. But freedoms also depend on other determinants, such as education and health services and civil rights.

After the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
by the UN, in 1948, Unesco published studies by 
scientists from around the world that disqualified 
racist doctrines and demonstrated the unity of the human

of the alleged racial superiority of the white man and 
to condemn the aberrations committed in his name.

Much is said nowadays about human rights. 
Well, it was in the 18th century - in 1789, precisely - 
that a Constituent Assembly produced and proclaimed 
in Paris the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of 
the Citizen. This Declaration was imposed as necessary 
for a group of revolutionaries, as it was prepared 
for a change in the realm of ideas and mentalities: 
the Enlightenment.

In the beginning was the Word. The sentence that opens the first chapter of the Gospel of John and refers to the creation of the world, as Genesis also does, is the most famous in the Bible. The idea that the world is created by the word, however, is so structuring that it is present in other religions, far beyond those founded in Christianity. As humans, language is the world we inhabit. Just try to imagine a world where we cannot use words to talk about ourselves and others to understand what that means. Or a world where what you say is not understood by others, and what others say is not understood by you.
What happens then when the word is destroyed and, with it, language?
For centuries, in different societies and languages, it is important to remember, language has served — and still serves — to maintain privileges of powerful groups and leave everyone else out. Who understands the language of lawyers, judges, and prosecutors, the language of doctors, the language of bureaucrats, the language of scientists? Most of the population has been subjected to the violence of being deliberately prevented from understanding the language of those who determine their destinies.
If the beginning is the Word, the end can be silence. Even if it is filled with screams among those who no longer have a common language to understand each other. []","{

From the village of Ão, or from the nearby sites, someone urgently needed to want to come to listen to the radio soap opera. He listened to it, learned it, kept it in mind, and, returning to Ão, the next day, he repeated it to others.
So they were having dinner, the people from the village came to receive the new part of the radio soap opera. They had already heard everything once, it was out of the ordinary: the truck of a buyer of chickens and eggs had failed there in Ão the day before, Mr. Abrãozinho Buristém, who was carrying a small battery-powered radio, had set up a wire on the wire fence... But they wanted to listen again, for confirmation. - ""The story is stable and good, even though it's long: it throws and doesn't yield..."" - Zuz explained to Dalberto.
Soropita began to retell the chapter of the soap opera. Without effort, he remembered the words, even clearly - he was amazed by that. He told with pleasure to delay, to fill the room with the power of other high characters. To capture everyone's attention, he could tell that night ahead. It was necessary to bring light, some couldn't see each other anymore; when someone laughed, it was from far away. The chapter of the soap opera was ending. []","{

The museum housed, among more than 20 million pieces, the skeletons with the answers to questions that had not yet been answered - or even asked - by Brazilian researchers. And the fire may have forever silenced ancestral indigenous words and songs, from languages that no longer exist in the world. The collection at the site contained recordings of conversations, songs, and rituals of dozens of indigenous societies, many made during the 1960s with old reel-to-reel recorders and that had not yet been digitized. Some of the records addressed already extinct languages, with no original speakers still alive. 'The hope is that other institutions have records of these languages,' says linguist Marilia Facó Soares. The researcher, who works with the Tikuna Indians, the largest group in the Brazilian Amazon, believes she has lost part of her material. 'I will have to make new field trips to rebuild my files. But obviously, it is not possible to recover the speech of deceased natives, usually the elderly,' she laments.","{

39,"LANGUAGES, CODES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES",2023,"If the interference of fake accounts in political discussions on social media already represented a danger to democratic systems, their sophistication and greater resemblance to real people have worsened the problem worldwide.
The danger has grown because technology and methods have evolved from robots, the 'bots' — software with automated online tasks —, to 'cyborgs' or 'trolls', accounts controlled directly by humans with the help of a little automation.
But researchers are now beginning to observe other patterns of behavior: when messages are not programmed, their publication is concentrated only during working hours, as it is controlled by people whose profession is exactly that, managing a fake profile during the day.
Another clue: the poor vocabulary of the messages published by these profiles. An employee of a company that supposedly produced and sold fake profiles explains that sometimes 'creativity was lacking' to create distinct messages while controlling so many fake profiles at the same time. []","{

The estimate, if nothing is done, is that a staggering 2.4 million traffic deaths will be reached in 2030 worldwide.
The constant rush, the feeling of invincibility, the certainty of invulnerability, the need for power, the lack of civility, the certainty of impunity, the absence of solidarity, the lack of compassion and the disrespect for oneself are real circumstances that often contribute to violent behavior in traffic.
The Yellow May, which advocates attention to life, is one of the initiatives in this direction. And it is precisely attention to life that is forgotten. This attention certainly requires less rush, more civility, assured limits, awareness of vulnerability, solidarity, compassion, and respect for oneself and others.

I have two breasts, these two thighs, two hands that are very useful to me, dark eyes, these two eyebrows that I fill in with makeup bought for nineteen and ninety and ears that do not accept jewelry. This body is a hungry, toothed, cruel, capable and violent body. I move my arms and crowds run desperate. I walk in the dark with my face down, because each isolated part of me has its own life and I do not want to tame them. Animal of the caatinga. Too strong. Swallower of swords and thorns.
They say and I heard, but then I also read, that the state of Ceará abolished slavery four years before the rest of the country. All those bodies that were brought with their fingers counted, their heels ready and their navels on fire, all of them were interrupted at the port. A man — they say and I heard and then I also read — led the uprising. And all these bodies went to seek other discomforts. They went to be bothered. []","{

A small Brazilian publisher, Urutau, has just launched in Lisbon an “anti-racist anthology of foreign poets in Portugal”, entitled Go back to your land.
The book denounces the various forms of racism to which immigrants are subjected. Some of the Brazilian poets anthologized complain about the disdain with which a large number of Portuguese people welcome Brazilian Portuguese. It is a common complaint.
“Here in Portugal they say / - they say - / that our Portuguese is wrong, that we do not speak Portuguese”, writes the São Paulo poet Maria Giulia Pinheiro, to conclude: “If your language, the Lusitanian one, / still retains the word of oppression / it is not the most beautiful in the world./ It is one of the most violent.” []","{

Even that time I could see the bizarreness of the customs that constituted the more or less constant laws of his world: as I approached, I verified that Mr. Timóteo, fat and sweaty, wore a dress with fringes and sequins that had belonged to his mother. The bodice descended excessively tight at the waist, and here and there a little of the imprisoned flesh burst through the seam, fraying the fabric and making the pleasure of dressing in that way a true kind of torment. He moved slowly, swaying all his fringes and vigorously fanning himself with one of those sandalwood wooden fans, which enveloped him in a nauseating wave of perfume. I don't know exactly what he had put on his head, it looked more like a turban or a hat without brims from which vigorous strands of blond hair emerged. As was also his custom, he wore makeup on his face — and for this, as well as for his clothing, he had taken over all the wardrobe left by his mother, also in her time famous for the extravagance with which she dressed — which undoubtedly made his huge nose stand out, so characteristic of the Meneses family.

Room of Junk: Diary of a Slumdweller
Carolina Maria de Jesus
How horrible it is to see a child eating and asking: 'Is there more?' This word 'more' keeps oscillating inside the brain of a mother who looks at the pots and there is no more.
## TEXT 2
The experience of seeing hungry children in the 1950s, described by Carolina, is experienced in Brazil in 2021 by a resident of Petrolândia, in Pernambuco. 'I used to work as a hairdresser's assistant, but the girl who had the salon closed. I was supporting myself with the aid I had, but now I was not included. Sometimes people help me with food for my children. Occasionally, I find some odd job to do, but it's very rare. There are days when I don't even have my baby's milk.' []","{

47,HUMANITIES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"In southern Bahia, since the 18th century, there have been records of a type of agroforestry system. To this day, this system is a striking feature of the region's landscape, known as cabruca, which consists of cultivating cocoa under the canopy of the native forest.

The farmer, the woman, and four children, sleeping in a shack with four coffin walls, covered in zinc. The water from the mangrove, at high tide, entered the house.

Near the street, they washed cowhide, goat skin for a Spanish tannery. Poisoned fish died, and when the tide went out, the vultures filled their crops, pecked at the mud, strolling through the puddles by the huts in Recife. []","{

51,HUMANITIES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"## Interdisciplinary studies broaden knowledge about chinesice in the baroque of Minas Gerais
Silk, aromatic woods and textiles, works of art, wool, crystals and many, many pieces of porcelain arrived in Brazil during the 17th and 18th centuries. The opulence provided by gold made these items even more present in mining cities such as Ouro Preto, Mariana and Sabará. These objects inspired the creation of chinesices, a term that designates a type of art that evokes Chinese motifs, present in various baroque churches in Minas Gerais. In Brazil, it is very likely that the inspiration for the paintings in baroque churches with birds, elephants, tigers, mandarins and pagodas was taken from engravings, fabrics, furniture and, mainly, from Chinese porcelain that circulated freely in a society enriched by the trade of gold and gemstones.

In the reports published about the inauguration of the São Paulo Museum of Art in 1947, when it still occupied a building on Sete de Abril street, Lina Bo Bardi was not mentioned at all. The architect was responsible for the museum project that would forever change São Paulo's position in the global art circuit. But there was no record of it. The praise focused on her husband and professional partner, the respected art critic Pietro Maria Bardi. 75 years later, the once ignored woman received a posthumous Golden Lion, the highest honor of the Venice Architecture Biennale, and now has her story told in two weighty biographies, which seek to unravel a career marked by audacity and contradiction.","{

With a population of 25 million inhabitants (about 60 percent of Muslim minorities, mainly of Uighur ethnicity), Xinjiang is a strategic region for China. It borders eight countries, is a crucial artery of the Chinese Belt and Road mega-infrastructure project, and has the largest national reserves of coal and natural gas.
## TEXT 2
Among the provinces of the Western Region, Xinjiang stands out by receiving more than 1.7 million migrants between 2000 and 2010. The main reason for this migratory flow is that the government provides subsidies to the population aiming to increase the proportion of Han Chinese in relation to the local population of Turkish and Muslim ethnicities.

65,HUMANITIES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"## Fifth conversation: man seen from the outside Maurice Merleau-Ponty
I could conclude that anger is a thought, that being angry is thinking that someone is detestable, and that this thought, like all others - as Descartes showed - could not reside in any fragment of matter. Anger would therefore be spirit. However, when I turn to my own experience of anger, I must confess that it was not outside my body, but inexplicably in it. []","{

I had no other philosophy. Nor did I. I do not say that the University had not taught me anything; but I only memorized its formulas, vocabulary, skeleton. I treated it as I treated Latin; I pocketed three verses of Virgil, two of Horace, a dozen moral and political locutions, for conversation expenses. I treated them as I treated history and jurisprudence. I gathered from all things the phraseology, the shell, the ornamentation. []","{

The pessimist
Gabriel García Márquez
Gerineldo sleeps because he is already resigned to his world. Because he already knows everything that can happen to him after subjecting all the objects around him to a meticulous inventory of possibilities. His apartment, more than an apartment, is a theory of luck and misfortune. Better than anyone, Gerineldo knows the coefficient of expansion of his windows and keeps marked on the thermometer, with a red line, the point at which the glass will break, shattered into shards of death. He knows that architects and engineers have already predicted everything, except what has never happened before.
## TEXT 2
Being and Nothingness: An Essay on Phenomenological Ontology
Jean-Paul Sartre
The situation is the whole subject (he is nothing but his situation) and is also the whole thing (there is never anything but things). It is the subject elucidating things by its own overcoming, if we wish; or it is things sending back to the subject his image. It is total facticity, the absolute contingency of the world, of my birth, of my place, of my past, of my surroundings - and it is my limitless freedom that makes facticity exist for me. []","{

In their view, there is a clear risk of unfair competition, as in Europe, it is necessary to follow stricter production rules, which increases the process costs. Thus, they would not be able to compete with, for example, Brazilian meat prices and would have their businesses threatened. On the other hand, the European industrial sector mobilizes in favor of the agreement, since tariff reductions in international trade would give greater access to the South American market.

Honoré de Balzac
During the French Revolution, a certain priest Niollant hid in the small castle of L’Escarbas. He paid generously for the hospitality of the old nobleman by taking care of his daughter's education, Anaïs. The presence of the mother did not change this masculine education given to a young creature already very inclined to independence due to life in the countryside. The priest passed on to the student his fearlessness of opinions and his ease of judgment, without thinking that these qualities, so necessary in a man, become defects in a woman destined for the humble tasks of a family mother. Although the priest continually recommended to the student to be as graceful and modest as her knowledge was extensive, Miss de Nègrepelisse had an excellent opinion of herself. []","{

74,HUMANITIES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"## TEXT 1
Originating from Romania, Genny Gleizer arrived in Brazil in 1932. Like thousands of Jews from Eastern Europe, her coming to Brazil occurred at a time of rising anti-Semitism in Europe that made their lives precarious. Brazil presented itself as a possibility in the search for survival and development.
## TEXT 2
The Jewish presence in Brazil gradually created certain suspicions that were reflected in the press and in intellectual and political circles. In part, this negative image would stem from the nationalist wave that emerged in the late 1910s, which saw immigrants as competitors to Brazilian workers, or as unproductive beings, exploiters of labor and native wealth. In addition, the political elites of the time believed that foreigners carried anarchist and communist doctrines, alien to the “Brazilian people's character”. These “undesirables” would be an external evil that would corrupt the nation. []","{

79,HUMANITIES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"From the 1930s onwards, the principles of work rationalization began to be discussed in Brazil. Concerns about the kitchen and domestic work were introduced with sanitary medicine and the supply of gas and electricity for domestic use in the early 20th century. The organization of the kitchen aimed to achieve a simplification of tasks, with movement economy, and the cheapening of equipment, based on large-scale production. The standardization and rationalization of housing and its components aimed at a radical transformation of the house, especially the kitchen, and relied on both the development of new equipment and studies on the rationalization of domestic work. The main concern was the development of a new type of housing, which should induce a new social behavior. []","{

By now, only the wealthiest can dream of traveling to space, either by rocket or by a hybrid plane, but the entire global population will be able to feel the effects of these trips and technological advances. For such an adventure, companies had to create new technologies that may, at some point, return to society. The camera, now common worldwide, was once an invention to be used in telescopes, and titanium, used even in medicine, was developed for rocket construction.

87,HUMANITIES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"The Cavalgada de Sant'Ana is an expression of the devotion of the cowboys to the patron saint of Caicó (RN). From the 1950s to the 1970s, this event, then called Cavalaria, was celebrated by people living in the rural area of the municipality of Caicó. These people used animals (donkeys, mules, and horses) as their only means of transportation, especially to go to the city on market days, bringing their products to sell. Being in Caicó during the Feast of Sant'Ana, these farmers organized a cavalcade to the courtyard of the Cathedral of Sant'Ana to praise the saint and receive blessings for their animals. Around the 1970s, with the arrival of cars in the rural area of the municipality, this cultural expression was extinguished. The means of transportation using animals began to be replaced by cars, especially pickups and trucks, which transported the peasants to the city on market days and festivals. Since 2002, a group of people from Caicó has resumed this cultural expression and, together with the cowboys' association, holds the Cavalgada de Sant'Ana on the first Sunday of the Feast. The event, in addition to the participation of riders living in rural areas, also attracts people living in Caicó, neighboring cities, and fans of rodeos.","{

88,HUMANITIES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"From the 16th century onwards, at least in the upper classes, the fork began to be used as an eating utensil, coming through Italy first to France and then to England and Germany, after having served, for some time, only to remove solid foods from the platter. Henry III introduced it in France, probably bringing it from Venice. His courtiers were not a little ridiculed for this 'affected' way of eating and, at first, were not very skilled in the use of the utensil: at least it was said that half of the food fell from the fork on the way from the plate to the mouth. As recently as the 17th century, the fork was still basically a luxury item, usually made of silver or gold.","{

Down syndrome is a genetic alteration associated with trisomy of chromosome 21, that is, the individual has three chromosome 21 instead of a pair, as is normal. This occurs due to the union of a gamete containing one chromosome 21 with a gamete containing two chromosome 21. Although women with the syndrome are usually sterile, in 2008, in the countryside of São Paulo, one of them gave birth to a girl without Down syndrome.

101,NATURAL SCIENCES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"## Cyanide Toxicity
### Molecular Biology of the Cell
ATP production depends on the proton gradient generated by the respiratory chain. In these reactions, according to the scheme, electrons from the oxidation of NADH to positively charged NAD travel through the chain until they reach cytochrome c oxidase, reducing the iron from a 3 positive charge to a 2 positive charge. Oxygen acts as the final acceptor of these electrons, forming water. Cyanide is a highly toxic chemical species that has a high affinity for the 3 positive charge iron. When cells are exposed to cyanide, it binds to the 3 positive charge iron site of cytochrome c oxidase, preventing its conversion to a 2 positive charge iron and blocking the respiratory chain.
[[placeholder]] ['Scheme description: Six coupled reactions of the respiratory chain, in the following sequence: First reaction: Substrate from the nutrient generates CO2, while positively charged NAD generates NADH. Second reaction: NADH generates positively charged NAD, while carrier 1 goes from the oxidized form to the reduced form; Third reaction: Carrier 1 goes from the reduced form to the oxidized form, while carrier 2 goes from the oxidized form to the reduced form; Fourth reaction: Carrier 2 goes from the reduced form to the oxidized form, while carrier 3 goes from the oxidized form to the reduced form; Fifth reaction: Carrier 3 goes from the reduced form to the oxidized form, while the 3 positive charge iron of cytochrome c oxidase is converted to a 2 positive charge iron. Sixth reaction: Finally, coupled with the conversion of 2 positive charge iron to 3 positive charge iron, the production of H2O from O2 occurs.']","{

102,NATURAL SCIENCES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"Scientists can determine the age of a fossil with less than 40,000 years old using the carbon-14 or radioactive carbon method. This is done based on the relationship between the remaining carbon-14 in the fossil and the amount of carbon-14 in a similar current species. Despite undergoing radioactive decay, the amount of carbon-14 in the atmosphere, particularly in CO2 molecules, is practically constant, due to the incidence of cosmic rays that reach the Earth at all times. Thus, as part of the carbon cycle, animals and plants maintain a practically constant amount of carbon-14 in their constitution while they are alive. However, when they die, the entry of carbon into the organism ceases and this number decreases as carbon-14 decays radioactively. The half-life of carbon-14, that is, the time required for half of the radioactive atoms in a sample to decay, is constant and approximately 5,730 years.","{

104,NATURAL SCIENCES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"## Ancient Soil Chemists of the Amazon
Amazonian soils, rich in silicate, are not suitable for cultivation because they are unable to retain nutrients. However, archaeological discoveries have shown that the ancient inhabitants of the Amazon mastered the technique of preparing a natural agricultural input, called black earth. This input consisted mainly of a type of biochar obtained from the burning of organic matter, such as tree trunks, pieces of bones, and manure, capable of keeping the soil fertile for years.
It is admitted that the effect of biochar on soil fertilization was, in part, related to the presence of carboxylate organic groups on its surface, negatively charged (single COO bond with negative charge). These groups attract positive ions necessary as nutrients, such as those from potassium, calcium, and magnesium, as well as micronutrients, such as zinc and iron. This bond in the fertilized soil is predominantly ionic, as illustrated in the figure, where M of positive charge n represents the metallic cations. According to the Pauling scale, the electronegativity of the oxygen element is equal to 3.44.
[[placeholder]]
The table presents the electronegativity values of these five metallic elements.

| Metallic Element    | Electronegativity    |
|:---------------------|:----------------------|
| K                    | 0.82                  |
| Ca                   | 1.00                  |
| Mg                   | 1.31                  |

107,NATURAL SCIENCES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"## Urban cleaning booklet
According to the Federal Constitution, it is the responsibility of municipalities to manage urban cleaning and waste collection services (garbage). However, there are reports that part of this garbage ends up being incinerated, releasing toxic substances into the environment and causing accidents by explosions, especially when aerosol bottles are incinerated (for example: deodorants, insecticides, and repellents). The high temperature causes the vaporization of all the contents inside this type of bottle, increasing the pressure inside it until culminating in the explosion of the packaging.
Suppose a metallic aerosol bottle with a capacity of 100 milliliters, containing 0.1 mol of gaseous products at a temperature of 650 degrees Celsius at the time of the explosion.
Consider: R = 0.082 (L⋅atm)/(mol⋅K). []","{

112,NATURAL SCIENCES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"## The aircraft crew member and ionizing radiation
Cosmic rays are sources of ionizing radiation potentially dangerous to the human body. To quantify the dose of radiation received, the sievert is used, defined as the unit of energy received per unit of mass. Exposure to radiation from cosmic rays increases with altitude, which can pose a problem for aircraft crews. Recently, accurate measurements of ionizing radiation doses were taken for flights between Rio de Janeiro and Rome. The results have indicated that the average dose of radiation received during the cruise phase (which usually represents 80 percent of the total flight time) of this intercontinental route is 2 microsieverts per hour. International civil aviation standards limit the working time for crews operating on intercontinental flights to 1,000 hours per year. Consider that the dose of ionizing radiation for a chest X-ray is estimated at 0.2 millisieverts. []","{

Now, users who use type 1 equipment can also use type 2 equipment, represented in the figure, to lift loads corresponding to masses M1 (on type 1 equipment) and M2 (on type 2 equipment), at a constant speed. In order for the exercise to be performed with the same vector force F, users must be informed about the relationship between the loads on the two types of equipment, since the fixed pulleys only change the direction of the forces, while the movable pulley divides the forces.
In both equipment, consider the inextensible ropes, the masses of the pulleys and ropes negligible, and that there is no energy dissipation.

124,NATURAL SCIENCES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"## Update of the recommendation of the Portuguese Society of Neonatology
The glass containing aluminum in its composition is an excellent material for storing medications and supplements, as it can be sterilized by heating. However, when the medication or supplement contains substances that strongly bind to the ion of this metal, the dissolution of aluminum is promoted due to the displacement of the chemical equilibrium established between the species immobilized in the glass and the species in solution. For this reason, it is recommended that newborn nutrition supplements containing calcium gluconate be stored in plastic packaging, and not in this type of glass. []","{

147,MATHEMATICS AND ITS TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"Students working with robotics created a 'smart faucet' that automates its opening and closing during hand cleaning. The technology works as follows: when hands are placed under the faucet, it releases water for 3 seconds so that the person can wet them. Then, it stops the water supply for 5 seconds while the person lathers their hands, and finishes the cycle by releasing water for rinsing for another 3 seconds. Consider the time (t), in seconds, counted from the moment the cycle starts. The water flow in this faucet is constant.

152,MATHEMATICS AND ITS TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"Aiming to attract more customers, the manager of a store announced a promotion in which each customer who makes a purchase can win a voucher to be used on their next purchase. To win their voucher, the customer needs to randomly draw a ball from each of the two urns A and B made available by the manager, in which there are only black and white balls. Currently, the probability of randomly choosing a black ball in urn A is 20 percent and the probability of choosing a black ball in urn B is 25 percent. The customer who draws two black balls, one from each urn, wins the voucher. Over the days, the manager realized that, for the promotion to be viable for the business, it was necessary to change the customer's success probability without changing the promotion rule. To do this, he decided to change the number of white balls in urn B so that the probability of a customer winning the voucher would be less than or equal to 1 percent. It is known that urn B has 4 black balls and that, in both urns, all balls have the same probability of being drawn.","{

Therefore, preventive measures are adopted in an industry according to the machine the employee operates and the sound intensity level N, measured in decibels (dB), to which the worker is exposed, with N equal to the base 10 logarithm of I raised to 10 minus the base 10 logarithm of I0 raised to 10, where I is the sound intensity and I0 is equal to 10 raised to -12, watts per square meter. When the sound is considered low, that is, N is equal to 48 decibels or less, preventive measure 1 should be used. In the case of moderate sound, when N is in the range (48 decibels, 55 decibels), preventive measure 2 should be used. When the sound is moderately high, which corresponds to N in the range (55 decibels, 80 decibels), the preventive measure to be used is 3. If N is in the range (80 decibels, 115 decibels), when the sound is considered high, preventive measure 4 should be used. And if the sound is considered very high, with N greater than 115 decibels, preventive measure 5 should be used.

180,MATHEMATICS AND ITS TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"Among marathon runners, a parameter used is the running economy (EC). The value of this parameter is calculated by the ratio between oxygen consumption, in milliliter (mL) per minute (min), and the mass, in kilogram (kg), of the athlete running at a constant speed.
A marathon runner, aiming to improve his performance, assisted by a doctor, measures his oxygen consumption per minute at a constant speed. Based on this consumption and the athlete's mass, the doctor calculates the athlete's EC.","{
