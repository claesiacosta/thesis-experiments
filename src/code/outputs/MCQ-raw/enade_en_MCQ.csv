Representative democracy requires, for its functioning, a set of characteristics, which can be understood as institutions. They are: Elected officials; Free, fair and frequent elections; Inclusive suffrage; Right to run for elective office; Freedom of expression; Diversified sources of information; Autonomy for associations. Among the mentioned categories, two stand out as pillars of the democratic regime.
Freedom of expression: citizens have the right to express themselves, without the danger of severe punishments, regarding political matters in general, which includes the freedom to criticize government officials, the government itself, the regime, the socioeconomic order, and the dominant ideology.
Diversified sources of information: citizens have the right to seek alternative, diversified, and independent sources of information. Furthermore, the existence of alternative sources of information must be protected by law.

Although political regimes can be overthrown and ideologies criticized and stripped of their legitimacy, behind a regime and its ideology there is always a way of thinking and feeling, a series of cultural habits, a nebula of obscure instincts and unfathomable impulses.

In addition to a lawsuit regarding the Temporal Framework being processed in the Judiciary, there is also a bill in the Chamber of Deputies that seeks to turn the Temporal Framework thesis into law. It is Bill No. 490/2007, which determines that only the peoples who were occupying the lands considered ancestral on the day of the promulgation of the Federal Constitution, on October 5, 1988, should have the right to these lands.
Available on g1.globo website. Accessed on: June 21, 2022 (adapted).
TEXT 2
The murder of the indigenist Bruno Pereira and the journalist Dom Phillips exposed to the world the importance of demarcating indigenous territories, guaranteed by the 1988 Federal Constitution. Indigenous territories, besides preserving identities, ways of life, traditions, and cultures of these peoples, are also essential for environmental preservation. They contribute to containing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting biodiversity, and enhancing systems.
If the Temporal Framework criterion is maintained, the land conflict may intensify. The territories will become areas of more conflicts between farmers, miners, prospectors, land grabbers, rural producers, drug traffickers, fish traders, hunters, and loggers, resulting in the death of indigenous people and forest defenders, and by extension, of indigenous territories.","{

The murder of the indigenist Bruno Pereira and the journalist Dom Phillips exposed to the world the importance of demarcating indigenous territories, guaranteed by the 1988 Federal Constitution. Indigenous territories, besides preserving identities, ways of life, traditions, and cultures of these peoples, are also essential for environmental preservation. They contribute to containing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting biodiversity, and enhancing systems.
If the Temporal Framework criterion is maintained, the land conflict may intensify.

Photo of Charles Humpres showing graffiti by Eduardo Kobra. The art occupies the side space of two floors of a building, characterized by the intense use of contrasts and colors that portrays a man sitting on the ground, head down, barefoot, with two empty plates by his side and holding a sign that reads 'Welcome to real Brazil'.
Initially, the transgressive nature of graffiti was seen by the State as vandalism in public space and as a danger to the conservation of private property, therefore, it should be combated. Over time, however, this marginal conception has transformed, leading to an acceptable valorization by the State and positive for society. This transition of graffiti, from marginal art to recognized and accepted artistic expression, has revealed important aspects not only for graffiti professionals, but for society as a whole, as it incorporates the possibility of being an artistic product of cultural, economic, and ideological value.

Photo of Charles Humpres showing graffiti by Eduardo Kobra. The art occupies the side space of two floors of a building, characterized by the intense use of contrasts and colors that portrays a man sitting on the ground, head down, barefoot, with two empty plates by his side and holding a sign that reads 'Welcome to real Brazil'.
Initially, the transgressive nature of graffiti was seen by the State as vandalism in public space and as a danger to the conservation of private property, therefore, it should be combated. Over time, however, this marginal conception has transformed, leading to an acceptable valorization by the State and positive for society. This transition of graffiti, from marginal art to recognized and accepted artistic expression, has revealed important aspects not only for graffiti professionals, but for society as a whole, as it incorporates the possibility of being an artistic product of cultural, economic, and ideological value.

8,Administration,2022,"Description of the image:
Photo of Charles Humpres showing graffiti by Eduardo Kobra. The art occupies the side space of two floors of a building, characterized by the intense use of contrasts and colors that portrays a man sitting on the ground, head down, barefoot, with two empty plates by his side and holding a sign that reads 'Welcome to real Brazil'.
Initially, the transgressive nature of graffiti was seen by the State as vandalism in public space and as a danger to the conservation of private property, therefore, it should be combated. Over time, however, this marginal conception has transformed, leading to an acceptable valorization by the State and positive for society. This transition of graffiti, from marginal art to recognized and accepted artistic expression, has revealed important aspects not only for graffiti professionals, but for society as a whole, as it incorporates the possibility of being an artistic product of cultural, economic, and ideological value.

10,Administration,2022,"Among the theories used in Administration, Mathematical Theory is the one that focuses on rational decision-making process, based on mathematical, statistical, and computational procedures. This theory emerged between the 1940s and 1950s and has been present in managerial practices and trends since then. Game theory, queuing theory, probability theory, and linear programming, applied to managerial problems, are techniques and methods recurring in mathematical sciences that originated from Mathematical Theory. The recent evolution of the use of Mathematical Theory is evidenced in the methods and processes of Big Data, Business Intelligence, and Business Analytics, which use computational platforms with large volumes of data in different formats (numeric, textual, visual). When considering the different specialties and managerial functions, there are variations in the intensity of use of these tools, in areas that make intensive use of methods and tools, and in others that have reduced use. In addition, functional areas are linked, in a differentiated way, to different methods. Source of the Text: ANDRADE, R .; AMBONI, N. TGA - General Theory of Administration, 2017 (adapted).","{

11,Administration,2022,"The development of institutions within capitalist society, triggered by technological transformations in the late 19th century, led to the material and immaterial rationalization of productive processes. These institutions were meticulously studied by Max Weber (1864-1920), who focused on the analysis of the daily organization of society, on the division and coordination of the most diverse labor activities. These activities were based on the rational division of labor, on the requirement of specialization and differentiation of the functions performed by workers, and classified according to technical criteria, through subordination to a hierarchically organized and highly specialized authority.

17,Administration,2022,"With inflation, the purchasing power of the citizen is reduced if the salary does not keep up with the price increases. Subsequently, this reduction in consumption, due to the impoverishment of people, affects companies, which sell less because people are buying less. This process leads to a reduction in production and a decrease in GDP (Gross Domestic Product). In summary, inflation causes money to lose value, since it does not keep up with price increases, therefore reducing purchasing power and GDP. According to the Inflation Report of the Central Bank of Brazil, from July 2022, the expectations for the variation of the National Consumer Price Index (IPCA), as surveyed by Focus, are around 7.96% for 2022, and GDP growth was adjusted to 1.51%.","{

22,Administration,2022,"The business plan as a fundamental part of the entrepreneurial process is a tool that aims to structure the main concepts and alternatives for a correct analysis of the feasibility of the intended business. Carrying out the business plan involves several stages, with market analysis and competitiveness being important to review and adapt strategies to new challenges. The following figure presents the model of generic competitive strategies conceived by Porter. Description of the figure: In a chart, we have elements of Generic Competitive Strategies described. It is divided into two axes: Competitive Scope and Competitive Advantage, both subdivided into two variables. Competitive Scope is subdivided into: Broad Target and Narrow Target. Competitive Advantage is subdivided into: Lower Cost and Differentiation. From the relationships between the four variables we will have: • From the meeting of Lower Cost and Broad Target, we have 1. Cost Leadership; • From the meeting of Differentiation and Broad Target, we have 2. Differentiation; • From the meeting of Lower Cost and Narrow Target, we have 3A. Focus on Cost; • From the meeting of Differentiation and Narrow Target, we have 3B. Focus on Differentiation.","{

25,Administration,2022,"A startup, whose mission is to help students from different areas to find their first job, has a business model whose revenues are predominantly obtained from paid ads by recruiters. Currently, the startup has a database with over 350,000 students, containing both curriculum information and personal data of the candidates. In order to expand its revenues, the founders are considering selling user data from their database to other retail companies, which are interested in obtaining profile information from this audience. After consulting Law No. 13,709/2018 (General Data Protection Law - LGPD), they found out that the commercialization of personal data is prohibited in the Brazilian legal system. However, Article 12 of said law provides the following: 'Article 12. Anonymized data shall not be considered personal data for the purposes of this Law, except when the anonymization process to which they have been submitted is reversed, using exclusively its own means, or when, with reasonable efforts, it can be reversed. Paragraph 1. The determination of what is reasonable must take into consideration objective factors, such as cost and time required to reverse the anonymization process, according to the available technologies, and the exclusive use of its own means. Paragraph 2. Data used to form the behavioral profile of a specific natural person, if identified, may also be considered as personal data, for the purposes of this Law.' Regarding Article 5 of the LGPD, it is considered: 'III - anonymized data: data related to a data subject that cannot be identified, considering the use of reasonable and available technical means at the time of its processing.'","{

29,Administration,2022,"Although practiced, at least, since the 1970s, it is from 2010 that the intensification of Data-Driven Management is verified, which consists of taking data from transactional information systems or market intelligence, which used to remain unused, and transforming them into valuable information and knowledge for operational and strategic decisions. Machine learning and advanced statistics methods, previously ignored, have become part of the daily routine of companies and governments.
In the state sphere, an example of this change is the operation of the Innovation and Data Laboratory of the Government of Ceará, understood as a public innovation that articulates information technology, innovation, and operational management. At the Laboratory's 2-year event in 2021, its fundamental role in generating more impact in its deliveries was highlighted, with data that allows treating each individual as a citizen.

The binomial 'innovative idea + technology' is not the unequivocal key to success, why? The key issue is the 'business model', which can be translated as the element that connects what technology provides and what the market wants. A new technology that does not have a specific business model must know how to extract value from technological innovation. Therefore, the entrepreneur needs to structure his business model well, understanding how various resources interact, often in a complex way, and how the company can create and capture value from this interaction. In the tourism segment, for example, many people do not have the expertise or time to consult hotels on the internet or to enter a flight search site. For them, it is better to go to an agency. Innovative business models that have emerged in this segment have modified the market structure, and past travel agencies whose business core was the average customer have fallen by the wayside. With this, new business models focused on specific niches (for example, popular tourism) or customized products (for example, Safari in Namibia) have emerged.

34,Administration,2022,"Faced with the difficulties of evaluating staff performance during the period of social isolation due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it was recommended to adapt a widely used measure in Marketing for the area of People Management. The proposal was to use what they called 'Net Performance Promoters Score (NPPS)' or 'Net Performance Promoters Score (ELPD)', with evaluation based on three questions for each worker/employee: 1) What is the likelihood that you would recommend this organization as a workplace to friends or relatives?, with responses restricted to a 10-point scale, with extremes of 1 (indicating very unlikely) and 10 (indicating very likely); 2) Why did you indicate this score?, with an open-ended response; 3) What could be done for you to increase your score by 1 point?, with an open-ended response. Regarding the first question, respondents who indicated from 1 to 6 would be categorized as 'detractors', those who indicated 9 or 10 would be categorized as 'promoters', and the others would be categorized as 'passives'. The ELPD is defined as the difference between the percentage of promoters and the percentage of detractors. According to the proposal, it is a convenient, practical, relevant, and useful metric for measuring staff performance in times of crisis, and it may be useful after the end of the pandemic.

35,Administration,2022,"One of the main factors for organizational success today is the adoption of situational leadership. Situational leadership is understood as being based on adapting the way of leading, taking as a parameter the context in which the company and the team are. In situational leadership, changes are implemented in such a way that it is possible to promote motivation, productivity, and team engagement, which has an impact on business results. For most companies, leadership that recognizes and values individual merit is highly recommended. Some decades ago, many managers were uncompromising autocrats, who gave orders and showed little concern for those who were hierarchically below them. Over the years, this style of leadership has given way to more sensitive and effective approaches, and there is solid evidence that employees find these styles much more motivating. To maintain a sense of balance, leaders must meet the emotional needs of their employees, helping them realize that they are part of something important and communicating appreciation, concern, and support.

Representative democracy requires, for its functioning, a set of characteristics, which can be understood as institutions. They are: Elected officials; Free, fair and frequent elections; Inclusive suffrage; Right to run for elective office; Freedom of expression; Diversified sources of information; Autonomy for associations. Among the mentioned categories, two stand out as pillars of the democratic regime.
Freedom of expression: citizens have the right to express themselves, without the danger of severe punishments, regarding political matters in general, which includes the freedom to criticize government officials, the government itself, the regime, the socioeconomic order, and the dominant ideology.
Diversified sources of information: citizens have the right to seek alternative, diversified, and independent sources of information. Furthermore, the existence of alternative sources of information must be protected by law.
TEXT 2
Source of the Text: DAHL, R. A. On Democracy, EDU: UnB, 2001 (adapted).
Although political regimes can be overthrown and ideologies criticized and stripped of their legitimacy, behind a regime and its ideology there is always a way of thinking and feeling, a series of cultural habits, a nebula of obscure instincts and unfathomable impulses.

On June 20, 2022, the news website The Intercept Brazil, in partnership with the portal Catarinas, published a story denouncing that an 11-year-old girl, pregnant after being a victim of rape, had been kept by the Justice of Santa Catarina in a shelter for over a month, in order to prevent her from having a legal abortion. According to the story, published using text and video, the girl was taken to the hospital by her mother to undergo the procedure two days after the pregnancy was discovered. Although the Penal Code allows abortion in cases of sexual violence, the medical team refused to perform the procedure. The girl was then sent to the shelter by the court, under the justification that there was a risk that the mother would take some action to end the baby's life. The report shows video excerpts of the victim's mother's testimony (image below) and the girl herself. The case had wide media coverage and the same excerpts of the testimonies were reproduced on several newscasts.
Image description: Photograph taken from a video recorded on May 9, 2022, containing the testimony of the child's mother, shows the blurred image of the deponent next to a crucifix fixed on the wall. Below the photo, on black bars, is the following sentence: 'Mother: It's the last thing I ask for.'.

TEXT 2
The Statute of the Child and Adolescent (Law No. 8,069, of July 13, 1990) establishes, among other legal provisions, the right to freedom, respect, and dignity of these individuals.
In its art. 17, it establishes that 'the right to respect consists of the inviolability of the physical, psychological, and moral integrity of the child and the adolescent, encompassing the preservation of the image, identity, autonomy, values, ideas, beliefs, spaces, and personal objects'.
In 2009, the Statute was amended to include privacy among the specific measures for the protection of children and adolescents. In its art. 100, the document establishes that 'the promotion of the rights and protection of the child and the adolescent must be carried out with respect for intimacy, the right to image, and the reservation of their private life' (Included by Law No. 12,010, of 2009).","{

Below appear the texts: 'PROTESTS IN THE UNITED STATES' 'GUYS... THE AGENDA IS RACISM...' '3 MORE POLICEMEN WILL BE CHARGED FOR THE MURDER OF GEORGE FLOYD'. After the Em Pauta program, from GloboNews, was criticized on social media for only having white journalists and commentators talking about racism, the next day's show featured a team of black professionals to discuss the subject. Presenter Marcelo Cosme started the program by saying that they understood the message from internet users and, therefore, invited a team of black professionals to 'discuss a topic they know very well, because they face it in their lives'. On both days, the program addressed the wave of protests against racism that occurred in the United States after the death of George Floyd, suffocated by a white policeman in Minneapolis.

15,Journalism,2022,"Description of the images: Two photographs captured by people who witnessed an attack on a work of art are shown. In the first photo, the painting La Gioconda appears partially stained white. The second photo is out of focus and shows the image of a young person wearing a wig and a cap.
One of the most famous works of art in the world, La Gioconda (also known as Mona Lisa), was vandalized at the Louvre Museum in Paris. Someone threw what appears to be a pie at the painting. The person was disguised with a wig and was in a wheelchair. The person's identity has not been disclosed, and the motive for the attack is still unknown. Several visitors posted photos and videos of the incident on social media. The painting was undamaged as it is protected by a glass panel.

Since the modern period, photographs have been the subject of discussion about the exposure of suffering. This reflection has been developed around images that present various situations of catastrophes, wars, attacks, diseases, and accidents. If, on one hand, photographic images in mass media emerge as records of daily misfortunes and woes, on the other hand, the ethical implications of photojournalistic practice have shed light on the creation of a large gallery of sufferers transformed into examples of various themes that make up ordinary sufferings. This has been the target of criticism focused on both the exploitation of others' misfortunes and the critical and affective numbness of viewers stimulated by this torrent of images of suffering. However, photojournalism still plays an important role in the ways of perceiving the realities of the world, configuring itself as a complex field of visibility in which various pacts of access and distribution of places between bodies and speeches operate.

The truth that they are nothing but a business, they use it as an ideology intended to legitimize the garbage they purposely produce. They define themselves as industries, and the published figures of the earnings of their managing directors suppress any doubt about the social need for their products.

It is not enough to have a list of questions and wait for answers. The interview is used as one of the techniques to obtain information. The reporter listens to various sources and combines the information obtained with others collected through research, observation, and documentation.

1,Law,2022,"TEXT 1
Representative democracy requires, for its functioning, a set of characteristics, which can be understood as institutions. They are: Elected officials; Free, fair and frequent elections; Inclusive suffrage; Right to run for elective office; Freedom of expression; Diversified sources of information; Autonomy for associations. Among the mentioned categories, two stand out as pillars of the democratic regime.
Freedom of expression: citizens have the right to express themselves, without the danger of severe punishments, regarding political matters in general, which includes the freedom to criticize government officials, the government itself, the regime, the socioeconomic order, and the dominant ideology.
Diversified sources of information: citizens have the right to seek alternative, diversified, and independent sources of information. Furthermore, the existence of alternative sources of information must be protected by law.

Source of the Text: DAHL, R. On Democracy, EDU: UnB, 2001 (adapted).
Although political regimes can be overthrown and ideologies criticized and stripped of their legitimacy, behind a regime and its ideology there is always a way of thinking and feeling, a series of cultural habits, a nebula of obscure instincts and unfathomable impulses.

In addition to a lawsuit regarding the Temporal Framework being processed in the Judiciary, there is also a bill in the Chamber of Deputies that seeks to turn the Temporal Framework thesis into law. It is Bill No. 490/2007, which determines that only the peoples who were occupying the lands considered ancestral on the day of the promulgation of the Federal Constitution, on October 5, 1988, should have the right to them.

TEXT 2
The murder of the indigenist Bruno Pereira and the journalist Dom Phillips exposed to the world the importance of demarcating indigenous territories, guaranteed by the 1988 Federal Constitution. Indigenous territories, besides preserving identities, ways of life, traditions, and cultures of these peoples, are also essential for environmental preservation. They help to contain greenhouse gas emissions, promote biodiversity, and enhance systems.
If the Temporal Framework criterion is maintained, the land conflict may intensify. The territories will become areas of more conflicts between farmers, miners, prospectors, land grabbers, rural producers, drug traffickers, fish traders, hunters, and loggers, resulting in the death of indigenous people and forest defenders, and, by extension, of indigenous territories.","{

Research results from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), linked to the United Nations (UN), indicate that, in addition to intimate femicide, perpetrated by partners or ex-partners of the victim, and systemic sexual femicide, where the victim is kidnapped and raped, there is lesbophobic or biphobic femicide, configured when the victim is bisexual or lesbian and is murdered because the aggressor believes she should be punished for her sexual orientation.

Initially, the transgressive nature of graffiti was seen by the State as vandalism in public space and as a danger to the conservation of private property, therefore, it should be combated. Over time, however, this marginal conception has transformed, leading to an acceptable valorization by the State and positive for society. This transition of graffiti, from marginal art to recognized and accepted artistic expression, has revealed important aspects not only for graffiti professionals but for society as a whole, as it incorporates the possibility of being an artistic product of cultural, economic, and ideological value.

9,Law,2022,"TEXT 1
Constitutional supremacy translates into formal and material superlegality. Formal superlegality identifies the Constitution as the primary source of normative production, dictating competences and procedures for the elaboration of lower normative acts. And material superlegality subordinates the content of all state normative activity to conformity with the principles and rules of the Constitution. The non-compliance with these formal and material prescriptions triggers a mechanism for protecting the Constitution, known among us as constitutional review.

13,Law,2022,"Between Tax Law and Economics there is a natural and necessary connection, since the State is the main responsible for economic regulation. Therefore, it is imperative for it to create mechanisms that point out to society and the market the economic model it has adopted. In this sense, Tax Law, in its extrafiscal function, seems to be the ideal tool to guide the taxpayer through the economic paths chosen by the State. It is said to be in its extrafiscal function because tax norms can also assume a fiscal and parafiscal function.
As observed, extrafiscality acts in a way to 'induce' the economic agent to behave as it seems desirable to the State. In this aspect, it has long been realized that tax law is better obeyed when, instead of determining behaviors, it uses the most subtle way to influence them, granting taxpayers subsidies, exemptions, presumed credits, bonuses, etc. With such artifice, people feel free to conduct their business and tend to do what the Nation expects of them.

14,Law,2022,"Taxation cannot be dissociated from the purposes of the State to promote the common welfare and to act ethically. The state's power to tax cannot disregard the fundamental rights of the citizen. In fact, the taxing power is legitimized and affirmed by respecting the rights of freedom and the constitutional principles linked to security, justice, and equality.
In this line of thought, in search of better tax justice, it is necessary to pay attention to the contributive capacity. To achieve this goal, tax benefits are sometimes used to mitigate the tax burden. In these cases, it can be considered, at first, that this was done to achieve higher purposes. The tax obligation cannot arise where contributive capacity is lacking. This capacity constitutes a requirement for personalization of the tax. Ethical taxation must be guided by respect for contributive capacity and the minimum existential necessary for survival.

15,Law,2022,"The basic principles of Criminal Law express the minimum platform on which a penal system committed to the Democratic Rule of Law can be erected.
Among these structuring norms, the principle of minimum intervention stands out, born from the Enlightenment ideals, which recognizes that punishment is an 'imperfect solution' for the protection of relevant legal goods, because it itself violates a category of this good - freedom - preventing the primary action of punitive power in defense of these interests. Therefore, the manifestation of punitive power is only legitimate when other forms of social control prove incapable of safeguarding serious disturbances to the legal order.

18,Law,2022,"Social and environmentally responsible management has been a recurring theme in the business environment when discussing economic development. The great challenge for companies is to develop sustainable activities and make profits while maintaining competitiveness.
Aiming to understand the impact of a culture of sustainability on the behavior and performance of companies, a department at Harvard University in the United States published the result of a scientific investigation after analyzing the economic life of 180 companies over a period of 18 years (from 1994 to 2012). It was found that sustainable companies generated much more profit than those that did not observe sustainability. According to the researchers, the profitability of sustainable companies resulted from the adoption of conscious and organized management.

27,Law,2022,"Caio, Eduardo and Paulo were charged with the crime of qualified homicide, for base motives, committed against a 60-year-old man. In the first phase of the Jury Trial procedure, Caio was acquitted, because the judge understood that there was not enough evidence of his participation in the crime, while Eduardo and Paulo were indicted. Both the Public Prosecutor's Office and Eduardo and Paulo challenged these decisions, which were upheld on appeal. At the end of the second phase of the Jury Trial procedure, in the plenary session, Eduardo and Paulo were convicted by the Jury. Immediately after, the presiding judge of the Jury Trial imposed a sentence of 14 years of imprisonment on Eduardo, and 15 years of imprisonment on Paulo, ordering both to be taken into custody. Dissatisfied with the sentence imposed, Eduardo and Paulo intend to appeal.","{

29,Law,2022,"Appeal - Minas Gerais Court of Justice
The integrity of the environment cannot be compromised by individual interests, just as strict liability, in the environmental field, guided by the principles of polluter-pays and full reparation, cannot be eluded by the application of the de minimis principle. The jurisprudence of the Superior Court of Justice and the Federal Supreme Court is firm in not allowing the prevalence of defense theses in environmental law that, through oblique means, seek to protect alleged acquired rights to deforestation, nor admit the invocation of the theory of fait accompli as a way to exempt the offender from the duty to promote the recovery of the area affected by human intervention. Otherwise, it would be endorsing that the fundamental, non-negotiable, and intergenerational right to a balanced environment, constitutionally enshrined in Article 225 of the Federal Constitution, could be subjugated to selfish claims. The refusal or partial application of the polluter-pays and full reparation principles risks projecting, morally, the harmful impression that environmental wrongdoing pays off. Therefore, the judicial response, in the case of environmental damage, must be vigorous, under penalty of the offender's impunity serving as social inspiration.

35,Law,2022,"The concept of transitional justice, considered in the context of International Human Rights Law, as institutional responses to be taken to confront violations of oppressive predecessor regimes, is based on the tripod of truth, memory, and justice. However, this threefold approach was not implemented in Brazil, due to the political choice adopted by the military regime, enshrined in the Amnesty Law (Law 6.683/1979), based on the ideals of forgiveness and forgetting. When judging the Direct Action of Unconstitutionality (ADPF) No. 153 in 2010, the Federal Supreme Court analyzed the constitutionality of the Amnesty Law in light of the 1988 Federal Constitution and expressed the understanding that the decision to enact the Amnesty Law stems from the state sovereignty of the country and, therefore, Brazil would not be obliged to revise it. In 2010, Brazil was condemned by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in the Gomes Lund case, which carried out the control of conventionality between the Brazilian Amnesty Law and the American Convention on Human Rights, in order to prevent the application of amnesty to crimes against humanity committed by public agents during the military regime. In 2018, Brazil was again condemned by the Inter-American Court for the deprivation of liberty, torture, and murder of journalist Vladimir Herzog within the premises of the Brazilian State body responsible for investigating citizens opposed to the regime. The aforementioned sentence confirmed the thesis that crimes committed by State agents during the military dictatorship era are serious violations of human rights and, therefore, non-prescriptible.","{

Representative democracy requires, for its functioning, a set of characteristics, which can be understood as institutions. They are: Elected officials; Free, fair and frequent elections; Inclusive suffrage; Right to run for elective office; Freedom of expression; Diversified sources of information; Autonomy for associations. Among the mentioned categories, two stand out as pillars of the democratic regime.
Freedom of expression: citizens have the right to express themselves, without the danger of severe punishments, regarding political matters in general, which includes the freedom to criticize government officials, the government itself, the regime, the socioeconomic order, and the dominant ideology.
Diversified sources of information: citizens have the right to seek alternative, diversified, and independent sources of information. Furthermore, the existence of alternative sources of information must be protected by law.
TEXT 2
Source of the Text: DAHL, R. On Democracy, EDU: UnB, 2001 (adapted).
Although political regimes can be overthrown and ideologies criticized and stripped of their legitimacy, behind a regime and its ideology there is always a way of thinking and feeling, a series of cultural habits, a nebula of obscure instincts and unfathomable impulses.

In addition to a lawsuit regarding the Temporal Framework being processed in the Judiciary, there is also a bill in the Chamber of Deputies that seeks to turn the Temporal Framework thesis into law. It is Bill No. 490/2007, which determines that only the peoples who were occupying the lands considered ancestral on the day of the promulgation of the Federal Constitution, on October 5, 1988, should have the right to them.

TEXT 2
The murder of the indigenist Bruno Pereira and the journalist Dom Phillips exposed to the world the importance of demarcating indigenous territories, guaranteed by the 1988 Federal Constitution. Indigenous territories, besides preserving identities, ways of life, traditions, and cultures of these peoples, are also essential for environmental preservation. They contribute to containing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting biodiversity, and enhancing systems.
If the Temporal Framework criterion is maintained, the land war could be intensified. The territories will become areas of more conflicts between farmers, miners, prospectors, land grabbers, rural producers, drug traffickers, fish traders, hunters, and loggers, resulting in the death of indigenous people and forest defenders, and, by extension, of indigenous territories.","{

Research results from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), linked to the United Nations (UN), indicate that, in addition to intimate femicide, perpetrated by partners or ex-partners of the victim, and systemic sexual femicide, where the victim is kidnapped and raped, there is lesbophobic or biphobic femicide, configured when the victim is bisexual or lesbian and is murdered because the aggressor believes she should be punished for her sexual orientation.

8,Psychology,2022,"Description of the image:
Photo of Charles Humpres showing graffiti by Eduardo Kobra. The art occupies the side space of two floors of a building, characterized by the intense use of contrasts and colors depicting a man sitting on the ground, head down, barefoot, with two empty plates beside him and holding a sign that reads 'Welcome to real Brazil'.
Initially, the transgressive nature of graffiti was seen by the State as vandalism in public space and as a danger to the conservation of private property, therefore, it should be combated. Over time, however, this marginal conception has transformed, leading to an acceptable valorization by the State and positive for society. This transition of graffiti, from marginal art to recognized and accepted artistic expression, has revealed important aspects not only for graffiti professionals but for society as a whole, as it incorporates the possibility of being an artistic product of cultural, economic, and ideological value.

10,Psychology,2022,"Domestic violence against women is a social problem with high incidence in Brazil. It is, therefore, a complex and sensitive topic for both research and intervention fields. Violence is experienced as a denial of humanity, evoking feelings of shame, humiliation, fears, which characterize the tension and difficulties of talking about the situation experienced. It is an experience of rights violation and interpersonal conflicts that involve ruptures in intimacy and trust relationships, permeated by moral judgments and models of masculinity and femininity that disqualify women and affect their subjectivities.

Early identification of anxiety disorders can prevent negative repercussions in the lives of children and adolescents, such as school dropout, excessive use of health services for somatic complaints associated with anxiety, and possibly the occurrence of psychiatric problems in adulthood.

20,Psychology,2022,"The population living on the streets is a serious expression of social inequality, as these individuals, without work and housing, remain on the margins of the productive process, excluded from the conditions to provide for their own survival, making the street the means to do so.

According to the guidelines on the Specialized Reference Center for the Population Living on the Streets (CENTRO POP) and Specialized Services, among the main actions aimed at serving the population living on the streets is institutional sheltering service, whose specificity lies in offering comprehensive protection that guarantees conditions for stay, coexistence, and a reference address, to provide privacy for people living on the streets, as well as families and individuals who are without reference and/or in a situation of threat.

26,Psychology,2022,"In 2020, with the Covid-19 pandemic, the world came into contact with new presentations of death, prompting society to reformulate its funeral rituals, also bringing the grief of mourning and the persistent fear of finitude. This also impacted the way children started to deal with this phenomenon, as well as the way adults started to address the subject with them. Childhood is characterized by being a period in which the child is in full physical and cognitive development and a loss requires a rethinking of this phenomenon, as well as facing it with the child.","{

In May 2022, Genivaldo de Jesus Santos was suffocated and killed by tear gas, according to the Forensic Medical Institute report, inside a Federal Highway Police vehicle in the state of Sergipe, after being approached for riding a motorcycle without a helmet. During the police approach, a nephew of the victim informed that he suffered from schizophrenia, had been in treatment for about 20 years, and was taking medication, which, in fact, was in his possession. Even though the police were informed, the approach continued with the use of force and violence, disproportionate to the risk posed by Genivaldo.

TEXT 2
At the beginning of the 20th century, the first eugenic initiatives emerged in the country, whose collective problems were understood from the unwanted proliferation of people who reproduced, over consecutive generations, spreading vicious, criminal, and degenerate behavioral and mental characteristics. Under the altruistic discourse of guaranteeing treatment, the insane-criminal came to be contained and isolated in judicial asylums, institutions linked to the prison system and administered, at the time, by important psychiatrists.

The goal is to address the difficulties commonly found in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), according to their degree and peculiarities, providing assistance to teachers and caregivers. When formulating school activities, they should also take care and pay attention to thinking about students with ASD, prioritizing, especially, issues related to language development and social behavior, favoring the production of promising responses in the school environment.

35,Psychology,2022,"Being a man or woman is a construction that occurs at levels far beyond the biological, meaning that it is not something installed in a genital. Gender identity based on a binary conception is a human reductionism and should be recognized as a cultural construction that insists on biological determinism, assuming postures that standardize an alignment between sex, gender, and desire. It is through these normative postures that we can understand the legitimacy of a psychopathological classification regarding the plurality of gender identities as well as stigmatizations, discriminatory and exclusionary actions that strengthen marginalization.
