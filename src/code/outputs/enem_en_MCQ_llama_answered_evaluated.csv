Researchers were able to stimulate the absorption of 
light energy in plants thanks to the use of carbon 
nanotubes. For this, carbon nanotubes 'inserted' into the interior of chloroplasts through a spontaneous assembly, through the membranes of the chloroplasts. Plant pigments absorb light radiation, electrons are 'excited' and move within the chloroplast membranes, and the plant then uses this electrical energy to produce sugars. Carbon nanotubes can absorb wavelengths usually not used by chloroplasts, and researchers had the idea of using them as 'antennas', stimulating the conversion of solar energy by chloroplasts, with increased electron transport.

The Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a disease 
caused by a mutation in a gene located on the 
X chromosome. Researchers studied a family 
in which monozygotic twins were carriers of a 
recessive mutant allele for this gene (heterozygous). 
The interesting fact is that one of the twins had 
the phenotype related to the mutant allele, that is, DMD,

To comply with current environmental standards, construction companies need to anticipate in their works the issue of using materials in order to minimize the impacts caused on site. Among these materials is the so-called concregram or pisogram, which is a type of coating composed of concrete pieces with empty areas filled with grass soil. The figures show these two forms of concrete flooring.

In this thermometer model, the black filaments 
record the minimum and maximum temperatures of the previous day 
and the gray filaments record the current room temperature, 
that is, at the moment of reading the thermometer. 

That's why it has two columns. In the left one, the 
numbers are in ascending order, from top to bottom, 
from -30 ºC to 50 ºC. In the right column, the numbers 
are ordered in ascending order, from bottom to top, 
from -30 ºC to 50 ºC.

The reading is done as follows:
•  the minimum temperature is indicated by the lower level 
of the black filament in the left column;

•  the maximum temperature is indicated by the lower level 
of the black filament in the right column;

•  the current temperature is indicated by the upper level

Therefore, the area of the region where the sweets are placed is the maximum when the angle of elevation θ is 60°, which means that the radius of the circular cutting section is 3 cm. The area of the region where the sweets are placed is the area of the melon minus the area of the spherical cap: 4/3π(5)^3 - 2/3π(5)^2(1-cos60°) = 523.6π - 523.6π/2 = π(261.8) = 261.8π.""}",D,The area of the region where the sweets are placed

To decorate a children's party table, a chef will use a spherical melon with a diameter measuring 10 cm as a support to stick various sweets. He will remove a spherical cap from the melon, as shown in the figure, and, to ensure the stability of this support, making it difficult for the melon to roll on the table, the chef will make the cut so that the radius r of the circular cutting section is at least 3 cm. On the other hand, the chef will want to have the largest possible area of the region where the sweets will be placed.

When Admiral Cabral
Set foot in Brazil
The guardian angel of the Indians
Was strolling in Paris.
When he returned from his trip
The Dutchman was already here.
The angel breathes happily:
""It's okay, these are good people,
I'll air out again.""
The angel crossed the bar,
Says goodbye to Pernambuco,
Makes noise, hubbub,
Just like the zeppelin
But a wind hit the angel,
He lost his memory...
And never came back.

Look at my people in the favelas and you will realize
From here I see a brand new car
Fully equipped and the old man driving
With his children by his side they are going to the park
Euphoric electronic toys
Automatically I imagine
The kids from the area how they are
Probably running around here and there
Playing barefoot soccer in the dirt streets
Yeah, they play the way they can
[...]
Look at that club, how cool
Look at that court, look at that field, look

Weekend at the park

Look at my people in the favelas and you will realize
From here I see a brand new car
Fully equipped and the old man driving
With his children by his side they are going to the park
Euphoric electronic toys
Automatically I imagine
The kids from the area how they are
Probably running around here and there
Playing barefoot soccer in the dirt streets
Yeah, they play the way they can
[...]
Look at that club, how cool
Look at that court, look at that field, look
Look how many people
There's an ice cream shop, cinema, hot pool
[...]
Here I don't see any sports club
No incentive for the kids to attend
The investment in leisure is very scarce
The community center is a failure

In the summer of 1954, the artist Robert Rauschenberg 
(b.1925) coined the term combine to refer to his 
new works that had aspects of both painting and 
sculpture.

In 1958, Bed was selected to be included in an 
exhibition of young American and Italian artists 
at the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy.
However, the festival organizers refused to 
show the work and removed it to a storage.

While the art world debated the innovation of 
hanging a bed on a wall, Rauschenberg 
considered his work 'one of the most welcoming 
paintings I've ever painted, but I've always been 
afraid someone would want to crawl into it'.

during a party and lost Helena (Alinne Moraes), an 
old and eternal passion. One day, an experiment with 
one of his inventions allows him to travel in 
time, returning to that time and being able to interfere 
in his destiny. But when he returns, he finds out that 
his life has completely changed and now he needs to find a way to change that story, even if he has to 
return to the past again. Will he be able to 
get things right?

If, then, for the things we do there is an end 
that we desire for its own sake and everything else is desired 
in the interest of that end; evidently such an end will be the good, 
or rather, the supreme good. But will not knowledge, 
perhaps, have great influence on this life? If so, 
let us strive to determine, even if only in general terms, what it is and from which of the sciences or 
faculties it constitutes the object. No one will doubt that 
its study belongs to the most prestigious art and that 
more truly can be called the master art. 
Now, politics shows to be of this nature, for it is she who 
determines which sciences should be studied 
in a State, which are those that each citizen should 
learn, and to what extent; and we see that even the most esteemed faculties, such as strategy, economics and 
rhetoric, are subject to it. Now, as politics uses 
the other sciences and, on the other hand, legislates on what 
we should and should not do, the purpose of this 
science must encompass those of the others, so that this 
purpose will be the human good.

The concept of democracy, in Habermas' thought, is built from a procedural dimension based on discourse and deliberation. Democratic legitimacy requires that the process of political decision-making occurs from a broad public discussion, only then deciding. Thus, the deliberative character corresponds to a collective process of weighing and analysis, permeated by discourse, which precedes the decision.

The concept of democracy, in Habermas' thought, is built from a procedural dimension based on discourse and deliberation. Democratic legitimacy requires that the process of political decision-making occurs from a broad public discussion, only then deciding. Thus, the deliberative character corresponds to a collective process of weighing and analysis, permeated by discourse, which precedes the decision.

The largest consumers of logistics infrastructure for export in Brazil are bulk products, among which stand out iron ore, oil and its derivatives, and soybeans, which, due to their low added value, and being moved in large volumes, require large-scale and low-cost infrastructure. In the case of soybeans, the infrastructure leaves much to be desired, resulting in huge queues of ships, trucks, and trains, which, as they remain idle in the queues for much of the time, have their costs increased, heavily burdening the exporter, affecting their profit margin and threatening our international competitiveness.

After the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
by the UN, in 1948, Unesco published studies by 
scientists from around the world that disqualified

have come to recognize the discriminatory nature 
of the alleged racial superiority of the white man and 
to condemn the aberrations committed in his name.

Another clue: the poor vocabulary of the messages published by these profiles.

In these reactions, according to the scheme, electrons from the oxidation of NADH to positively charged NAD travel through the chain until they reach cytochrome c oxidase, reducing the iron from a 3 positive charge to a 2 positive charge. Oxygen acts as the final acceptor of these electrons, forming water. Cyanide is a highly toxic chemical species that has a high affinity for the 3 positive charge iron. When cells are exposed to cyanide, it binds to the 3 positive charge iron site of cytochrome c oxidase, preventing its conversion to a 2 positive charge iron and blocking the respiratory chain.
[[placeholder]] ['Scheme description: Six coupled reactions of the respiratory chain, in the following sequence: First reaction: Substrate from the nutrient generates CO2, while positively charged NAD generates NADH. Second reaction: NADH generates positively charged NAD, while carrier 1 goes from the oxidized form to the reduced form; Third reaction: Carrier 1 goes from the reduced form to the oxidized form, while carrier 2 goes from the oxidized form to the reduced form; Fourth reaction: Carrier 2 goes from the reduced form to the oxidized form, while carrier 3 goes from the oxidized form to the reduced form; Fifth reaction: Carrier 3 goes from the reduced form to the oxidized form, while the 3 positive charge iron of cytochrome c oxidase is converted to a 2 positive charge iron.

Amazonian soils, rich in silicate, are not suitable for cultivation because they are unable to retain nutrients. However, archaeological discoveries have shown that the ancient inhabitants of the Amazon mastered the technique of preparing a natural agricultural input, called black earth. This input consisted mainly of a type of biochar obtained from the burning of organic matter, such as tree trunks, pieces of bones, and manure, capable of keeping the soil fertile for years.
It is admitted that the effect of biochar on soil fertilization was, in part, related to the presence of carboxylate organic groups on its surface, negatively charged (single COO bond with negative charge). These groups attract positive ions necessary as nutrients, such as those from potassium, calcium, and magnesium, as well as micronutrients, such as zinc and iron. This bond in the fertilized soil is predominantly ionic, as illustrated in the figure, where M of positive charge n represents the metallic cations.

Amazonian soils, rich in silicate, are not suitable for cultivation because they are unable to retain nutrients. However, archaeological discoveries have shown that the ancient inhabitants of the Amazon mastered the technique of preparing a natural agricultural input, called black earth. This input consisted mainly of a type of biochar obtained from the burning of organic matter, such as tree trunks, pieces of bones, and manure, capable of keeping the soil fertile for years.
It is admitted that the effect of biochar on soil fertilization was, in part, related to the presence of carboxylate organic groups on its surface, negatively charged (single COO bond with negative charge). These groups attract positive ions necessary as nutrients, such as those from potassium, calcium, and magnesium, as well as micronutrients, such as zinc and iron. This bond in the fertilized soil is predominantly ionic, as illustrated in the figure, where M of positive charge n represents the metallic cations. According to the Pauling scale, the electronegativity of the oxygen element is equal to 3.44.

159,107,NATURAL SCIENCES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"## Urban cleaning booklet
According to the Federal Constitution, it is the responsibility of municipalities to manage urban cleaning and waste collection services (garbage). However, there are reports that part of this garbage ends up being incinerated, releasing toxic substances into the environment and causing accidents by explosions, especially when aerosol bottles are incinerated (for example: deodorants, insecticides, and repellents). The high temperature causes the vaporization of all the contents inside this type of bottle, increasing the pressure inside it until culminating in the explosion of the packaging.

Let's call the distance between the point P and the point on the ground 'x'. We can use the Pythagorean theorem as follows:

10^2 = h^2 + x^2

Since the flagpole is perpendicular to the ground, h is equal to the height of the flagpole. Given that the height of the flagpole is h, we can rewrite the equation as:

10^2 = h^2 + x^2

Simplifying the equation, we get:

100 = h^2 + x^2

Now, we need to find the value of h. Since the length of each steel cable is 10 meters, we can use the equation to find the value of h.

h = √(100 - x^2)

Now, we can substitute the value of h into the equation:

x = √(100 - h^2)

To find the value of x, we need to find the value of h. Since the height of the flagpole is h, we can use the equation to find the value of h.

h = √(100 - x^2)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

h = √(100 - 6.32^2)

Now, we can substitute the value of h into the equation:
