Researchers were able to stimulate the absorption of 
light energy in plants thanks to the use of carbon 
nanotubes. For this, carbon nanotubes 'inserted' into the interior of chloroplasts through a spontaneous assembly, through the membranes of the chloroplasts. Plant pigments absorb light radiation, electrons are 'excited' and move within the chloroplast membranes, and the plant then uses this electrical energy to produce sugars. Carbon nanotubes can absorb wavelengths usually not used by chloroplasts, and researchers had the idea of using them as 'antennas', stimulating the conversion of solar energy by chloroplasts, with increased electron transport.

The paper chromatography is a separation method based on the differential migration of components 
of a mixture between two immiscible phases. The sample components are separated between the stationary phase and 
the mobile phase moving on the paper. The stationary phase consists of practically pure cellulose, which can absorb 
up to 22% of water. It is the absorbed water that functions as a liquid stationary phase and interacts with the mobile phase, 
also liquid (liquid-liquid partition). Components capable of forming stronger intermolecular interactions 
with the stationary phase migrate more slowly.

In this thermometer model, the black filaments 
record the minimum and maximum temperatures of the previous day 
and the gray filaments record the current room temperature, 
that is, at the moment of reading the thermometer. 

That's why it has two columns. In the left one, the 
numbers are in ascending order, from top to bottom, 
from -30 ºC to 50 ºC. In the right column, the numbers 
are ordered in ascending order, from bottom to top, 
from -30 ºC to 50 ºC.

The reading is done as follows:
•  the minimum temperature is indicated by the lower level 
of the black filament in the left column;

•  the maximum temperature is indicated by the lower level

•  the current temperature is indicated by the upper level

The Tupi language in Brazil

300 years ago, living in the village of São Paulo de Piratininga (dried fish, in Tupi) was almost synonymous with speaking the Indian language. Out of every five inhabitants of the city, only two knew Portuguese. Therefore, in 1698, the governor of the province, Artur de Sá e Meneses, begged Portugal to only send priests who knew 'the general language of the Indians', because 'those people do not explain themselves in any other language'.

Derived from the dialect of São Vicente, the Tupi of São Paulo developed and spread in the 17th century, thanks to the geographical isolation of the city and the unchristian activity of the Paulista mamelucos: the bandeiras, expeditions to the backlands in search of Indian slaves. Many bandeirantes did not even speak Portuguese or expressed themselves poorly. Domingos Jorge Velho, the Paulista who destroyed the Quilombo dos Palmares in 1694, was described by the bishop of Pernambuco as 'a barbarian who doesn't even know how to speak'. In their wanderings, these people baptized places like Avanhandava (place where the Indian runs), Pindamonhangaba (place to make a fishing hook), and Itu (waterfall). And ended up inventing a new language.
'The slaves of the bandeirantes came from more than 100 different tribes,' says historian and anthropologist John Monteiro, from the State University of Campinas. 'This changed the Paulista Tupi, which, in addition to the influence of Portuguese, also received words from other languages.' The result of the mixture became known as the general language of the south, a kind of simplified Tupi.

The reveler

When Admiral Cabral
Set foot in Brazil
The guardian angel of the Indians
Was strolling in Paris.
When he returned from his trip
The Dutchman was already here.
The angel breathes happily:
""It's okay, these are good people,
I'll air out again.""
The angel crossed the bar,
Says goodbye to Pernambuco,
Makes noise, hubbub,
Just like the zeppelin
But a wind hit the angel,
He lost his memory...
And never came back.

When Admiral Cabral
Set foot in Brazil
The guardian angel of the Indians
Was strolling in Paris.
When he returned from his trip
The Dutchman was already here.
The angel breathes happily:
""It's okay, these are good people,
I'll air out again.""
The angel crossed the bar,
Says goodbye to Pernambuco,
Makes noise, hubbub,
Just like the zeppelin
But a wind hit the angel,
He lost his memory...
And never came back.

Publisher Planeta, 296 pages.

But it was a night, that Saturday night of October 21, 1967, that stopped our country. Stopped to watch the final of the III Record Festival, when a 24-year-old young man named Eduardo Lobo, Edu Lobo, left the Paramount Theater in São Paulo after winning the festival's top prize with Ponteio, which he sang accompanied by the charming and beginner Marília Medalha.

It was that night that Chico Buarque sang his Roda viva alongside MPB-4 of Magro, the arranger. That Caetano Veloso shone singing Alegria, alegria with the audience to the sound of the Beat Boys' guitars, that Gilberto Gil presented the tropicalist Domingo no parque with the Mutantes.

That night that ended up becoming a movie, in 2010, in the hands of Renato Terra and Ricardo Calil, has now become a book. The book being launched now is the story of that night, expanded and in a state that in journalistic jargon we call raw material. Those who saw the movie will delight in the stories - and some gossip - that each one has to tell, now without the necessary cuts that a movie demands. And those who did not see the movie have before them a book of stories, thinking well, of History.

Declaration of love

This is a confession of love: I love the Portuguese language. 
It is not easy. It is not malleable. [...] The Portuguese language is 
a real challenge for those who write. Especially for 
those who write, taking off the first layer of superficiality from things and people. 

Sometimes it reacts to a more complicated thought. Sometimes it is scared by the unpredictable 
of a sentence. I like to handle it - as I liked to be mounted on a horse and guide it by the reins, sometimes 
at a gallop. I wanted the Portuguese language to reach 
its maximum in my hands. And this desire is shared by all who write. A Camões and others alike were not enough 
to give us forever an inheritance of a language already made. 
All of us who write are making something that gives life to the grave of thought.

We have these difficulties. But I did not speak 
of the enchantment of dealing with a language that was not 
profound. What I inherited is not enough for me. 

If I were mute and also could not write, and 
they asked me which language I wanted to belong to, I would say: 
English, which is precise and beautiful. But, as I was not born mute and 
could write, it became absolutely clear to me 
that what I really wanted was to write in Portuguese. I even 
wished I had not learned other languages: just so that my 
approach to Portuguese would be virgin and clear.

Probably running around here and there
Playing barefoot soccer in the dirt streets

On that morning of clear sky and light air, due to the torrential rain of the previous night, I went out for a walk with the sun still hidden to take notice of the first movements of life in the countryside. It didn't take long and the intense smell of coffee brewed by Dona Linda invaded my nostrils and made hunger awaken from that lethargic state derived from the long night of sleep.

 Zé Araújo began to sing in a sad tone, telling 
to the curious who began to arrive that a woman 
had knelt at the feet of the holy cross and sworn in 
the name of Jesus a great love, but swore and did not fulfill, 
pretended and deceived me, you lied to me, you sinned against God, the heart has reasons that reason itself 
does not know, makes promises and vows, then forgets.

  The caboclo was sad and inspired. After this 
song that gave Neusa goosebumps, he followed with 
a waltz even more spirited, full of difficult words, 
but beautiful as only the serene drop. It was the story of a 
charming doll seen in a crystal showcase on the

Her hair had the color/ Of the sun radiating/ 
Fulvous rays of love./ Her eyes were circunvagos/
Of the blue romanticism of lakes/ Lyrical hands, some 
divine arms,/ A white body like no other/ And the feet 
very small./ Finally I saw in this doll/ A perfect 
Venus.

In the summer of 1954, the artist Robert Rauschenberg 
(b.1925) coined the term combine to refer to his 
new works that had aspects of both painting and 
sculpture.

In 1958, Bed was selected to be included in an 
exhibition of young American and Italian artists 
at the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy.
However, the festival organizers refused to 
show the work and removed it to a storage.

While the art world debated the innovation of 
hanging a bed on a wall, Rauschenberg 
considered his work 'one of the most welcoming 
paintings I've ever painted, but I've always been 
afraid someone would want to crawl into it'.

If, then, for the things we do there is an end 
that we desire for its own sake and everything else is desired 
in the interest of that end; evidently such an end will be the good, 
or rather, the supreme good. But will not knowledge, 
perhaps, have great influence on this life? If so, 
let us strive to determine, even if only in general terms, what it is and from which of the sciences or 
faculties it constitutes the object. No one will doubt that 
its study belongs to the most prestigious art and that 
more truly can be called the master art. 
Now, politics shows to be of this nature, for it is she who 
determines which sciences should be studied 
in a State, which are those that each citizen should 
learn, and to what extent; and we see that even the most esteemed faculties, such as strategy, economics and 
rhetoric, are subject to it. Now, as politics uses 
the other sciences and, on the other hand, legislates on what 
we should and should not do, the purpose of this 
science must encompass those of the others, so that this

The 8.8 Richter scale earthquake that hit the west coast of Chile in February caused significant changes in the region's map. According to a preliminary analysis, the entire city of Concepción shifted at least three meters to the west. Buenos Aires moved about 2.5 centimeters to the west, while Santiago, closer to the event location, shifted almost 30 centimeters to the west-southwest. The cities of Valparaíso, in Chile, and Mendoza, in Argentina, also had their positions significantly altered (13.4 centimeters and 8.8 centimeters, respectively).

After the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
by the UN, in 1948, Unesco published studies by 
scientists from around the world that disqualified 
racist doctrines and demonstrated the unity of the human 
species. Since then, most European scientists themselves 
have come to recognize the discriminatory nature 
of the alleged racial superiority of the white man and 
to condemn the aberrations committed in his name.

From the village of Ão, or from the nearby sites, someone urgently needed to want to come to listen to the radio soap opera. He listened to it, learned it, kept it in mind, and, returning to Ão, the next day, he repeated it to others.
So they were having dinner, the people from the village came to receive the new part of the radio soap opera. They had already heard everything once, it was out of the ordinary: the truck of a buyer of chickens and eggs had failed there in Ão the day before, Mr. Abrãozinho Buristém, who was carrying a small battery-powered radio, had set up a wire on the wire fence... But they wanted to listen again, for confirmation. - ""The story is stable and good, even though it's long: it throws and doesn't yield..."" - Zuz explained to Dalberto.

99,40,"LANGUAGES, CODES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES",2023,"May was colored in yellow, and it was because globally yellow is the conventional color for warnings. In traffic, these warnings have been fatal. The estimate, if nothing is done, is that a staggering 2.4 million traffic deaths will be reached in 2030 worldwide.
The constant rush, the feeling of invincibility, the certainty of invulnerability, the need for power, the lack of civility, the certainty of impunity, the absence of solidarity, the lack of compassion and the disrespect for oneself are real circumstances that often contribute to violent behavior in traffic.
The Yellow May, which advocates attention to life, is one of the initiatives in this direction. And it is precisely attention to life that is forgotten.

During the French Revolution, a certain priest Niollant hid in the small castle of L’Escarbas.

153,101,NATURAL SCIENCES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"## Cyanide Toxicity
### Molecular Biology of the Cell
ATP production depends on the proton gradient generated by the respiratory chain. In these reactions, according to the scheme, electrons from the oxidation of NADH to positively charged NAD travel through the chain until they reach cytochrome c oxidase, reducing the iron from a 3 positive charge to a 2 positive charge. Oxygen acts as the final acceptor of these electrons, forming water. Cyanide is a highly toxic chemical species that has a high affinity for the 3 positive charge iron. When cells are exposed to cyanide, it binds to the 3 positive charge iron site of cytochrome c oxidase, preventing its conversion to a 2 positive charge iron and blocking the respiratory chain.

156,104,NATURAL SCIENCES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"## Ancient Soil Chemists of the Amazon
Amazonian soils, rich in silicate, are not suitable for cultivation because they are unable to retain nutrients. However, archaeological discoveries have shown that the ancient inhabitants of the Amazon mastered the technique of preparing a natural agricultural input, called black earth. This input consisted mainly of a type of biochar obtained from the burning of organic matter, such as tree trunks, pieces of bones, and manure, capable of keeping the soil fertile for years.
It is admitted that the effect of biochar on soil fertilization was, in part, related to the presence of carboxylate organic groups on its surface, negatively charged (single COO bond with negative charge). These groups attract positive ions necessary as nutrients, such as those from potassium, calcium, and magnesium, as well as micronutrients, such as zinc and iron. This bond in the fertilized soil is predominantly ionic, as illustrated in the figure, where M of positive charge n represents the metallic cations. According to the Pauling scale, the electronegativity of the oxygen element is equal to 3.44.

Amazonian soils, rich in silicate, are not suitable for cultivation because they are unable to retain nutrients. However, archaeological discoveries have shown that the ancient inhabitants of the Amazon mastered the technique of preparing a natural agricultural input, called black earth. This input consisted mainly of a type of biochar obtained from the burning of organic matter, such as tree trunks, pieces of bones, and manure, capable of keeping the soil fertile for years.
It is admitted that the effect of biochar on soil fertilization was, in part, related to the presence of carboxylate organic groups on its surface, negatively charged (single COO bond with negative charge). These groups attract positive ions necessary as nutrients, such as those from potassium, calcium, and magnesium, as well as micronutrients, such as zinc and iron. This bond in the fertilized soil is predominantly ionic, as illustrated in the figure, where M of positive charge n represents the metallic cations. According to the Pauling scale, the electronegativity of the oxygen element is equal to 3.44.
