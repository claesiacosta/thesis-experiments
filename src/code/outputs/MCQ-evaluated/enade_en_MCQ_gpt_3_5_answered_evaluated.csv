Representative democracy requires, for its functioning, a set of characteristics, which can be understood as institutions. They are: Elected officials; Free, fair and frequent elections; Inclusive suffrage; Right to run for elective office; Freedom of expression; Diversified sources of information; Autonomy for associations. Among the mentioned categories, two stand out as pillars of the democratic regime.
Freedom of expression: citizens have the right to express themselves, without the danger of severe punishments, regarding political matters in general, which includes the freedom to criticize government officials, the government itself, the regime, the socioeconomic order, and the dominant ideology.
Diversified sources of information: citizens have the right to seek alternative, diversified, and independent sources of information. Furthermore, the existence of alternative sources of information must be protected by law.

29,10,Administration,2022,"Among the theories used in Administration, Mathematical Theory is the one that focuses on rational decision-making process, based on mathematical, statistical, and computational procedures. This theory emerged between the 1940s and 1950s and has been present in managerial practices and trends since then. Game theory, queuing theory, probability theory, and linear programming, applied to managerial problems, are techniques and methods recurring in mathematical sciences that originated from Mathematical Theory. The recent evolution of the use of Mathematical Theory is evidenced in the methods and processes of Big Data, Business Intelligence, and Business Analytics, which use computational platforms with large volumes of data in different formats (numeric, textual, visual).

Currently, the startup has a database with over 350,000 students, containing both curriculum information and personal data of the candidates. In order to expand its revenues, the founders are considering selling user data from their database to other retail companies, which are interested in obtaining profile information from this audience. After consulting Law No. 13,709/2018 (General Data Protection Law - LGPD), they found out that the commercialization of personal data is prohibited in the Brazilian legal system.

Anonymized data shall not be considered personal data for the purposes of this Law, except when the anonymization process to which they have been submitted is reversed, using exclusively its own means, or when, with reasonable efforts, it can be reversed. Paragraph 1.

The binomial 'innovative idea + technology' is not the unequivocal key to success, why? The key issue is the 'business model', which can be translated as the element that connects what technology provides and what the market wants. A new technology that does not have a specific business model must know how to extract value from technological innovation. Therefore, the entrepreneur needs to structure his business model well, understanding how various resources interact, often in a complex way, and how the company can create and capture value from this interaction. In the tourism segment, for example, many people do not have the expertise or time to consult hotels on the internet or to enter a flight search site. For them, it is better to go to an agency. Innovative business models that have emerged in this segment have modified the market structure, and past travel agencies whose business core was the average customer have fallen by the wayside. With this, new business models focused on specific niches (for example, popular tourism) or customized products (for example, Safari in Namibia) have emerged.

The proposal was to use what they called 'Net Performance Promoters Score (NPPS)' or 'Net Performance Promoters Score (ELPD)', with evaluation based on three questions for each worker/employee: 1) What is the likelihood that you would recommend this organization as a workplace to friends or relatives?, with responses restricted to a 10-point scale, with extremes of 1 (indicating very unlikely) and 10 (indicating very likely); 2) Why did you indicate this score?, with an open-ended response; 3) What could be done for you to increase your score by 1 point?, with an open-ended response. Regarding the first question, respondents who indicated from 1 to 6 would be categorized as 'detractors', those who indicated 9 or 10 would be categorized as 'promoters', and the others would be categorized as 'passives'. The ELPD is defined as the difference between the percentage of promoters and the percentage of detractors. According to the proposal, it is a convenient, practical, relevant, and useful metric for measuring staff performance in times of crisis, and it may be useful after the end of the pandemic.

The proposal was to use what they called 'Net Performance Promoters Score (NPPS)' or 'Net Performance Promoters Score (ELPD)', with evaluation based on three questions for each worker/employee: 1) What is the likelihood that you would recommend this organization as a workplace to friends or relatives?, with responses restricted to a 10-point scale, with extremes of 1 (indicating very unlikely) and 10 (indicating very likely); 2) Why did you indicate this score?, with an open-ended response; 3) What could be done for you to increase your score by 1 point?, with an open-ended response. Regarding the first question, respondents who indicated from 1 to 6 would be categorized as 'detractors', those who indicated 9 or 10 would be categorized as 'promoters', and the others would be categorized as 'passives'. The ELPD is defined as the difference between the percentage of promoters and the percentage of detractors.

Representative democracy requires, for its functioning, a set of characteristics, which can be understood as institutions. They are: Elected officials; Free, fair and frequent elections; Inclusive suffrage; Right to run for elective office; Freedom of expression; Diversified sources of information; Autonomy for associations. Among the mentioned categories, two stand out as pillars of the democratic regime.
Freedom of expression: citizens have the right to express themselves, without the danger of severe punishments, regarding political matters in general, which includes the freedom to criticize government officials, the government itself, the regime, the socioeconomic order, and the dominant ideology.
Diversified sources of information: citizens have the right to seek alternative, diversified, and independent sources of information. Furthermore, the existence of alternative sources of information must be protected by law.

On June 20, 2022, the news website The Intercept Brazil, in partnership with the portal Catarinas, published a story denouncing that an 11-year-old girl, pregnant after being a victim of rape, had been kept by the Justice of Santa Catarina in a shelter for over a month, in order to prevent her from having a legal abortion. According to the story, published using text and video, the girl was taken to the hospital by her mother to undergo the procedure two days after the pregnancy was discovered. Although the Penal Code allows abortion in cases of sexual violence, the medical team refused to perform the procedure. The girl was then sent to the shelter by the court, under the justification that there was a risk that the mother would take some action to end the baby's life. The report shows video excerpts of the victim's mother's testimony (image below) and the girl herself. The case had wide media coverage and the same excerpts of the testimonies were reproduced on several newscasts.
Image description: Photograph taken from a video recorded on May 9, 2022, containing the testimony of the child's mother, shows the blurred image of the deponent next to a crucifix fixed on the wall.

On June 20, 2022, the news website The Intercept Brazil, in partnership with the portal Catarinas, published a story denouncing that an 11-year-old girl, pregnant after being a victim of rape, had been kept by the Justice of Santa Catarina in a shelter for over a month, in order to prevent her from having a legal abortion. According to the story, published using text and video, the girl was taken to the hospital by her mother to undergo the procedure two days after the pregnancy was discovered. Although the Penal Code allows abortion in cases of sexual violence, the medical team refused to perform the procedure. The girl was then sent to the shelter by the court, under the justification that there was a risk that the mother would take some action to end the baby's life. The report shows video excerpts of the victim's mother's testimony (image below) and the girl herself. The case had wide media coverage and the same excerpts of the testimonies were reproduced on several newscasts.
Image description: Photograph taken from a video recorded on May 9, 2022, containing the testimony of the child's mother, shows the blurred image of the deponent next to a crucifix fixed on the wall. Below the photo, on black bars, is the following sentence: 'Mother: It's the last thing I ask for.'.

This reflection has been developed around images that present various situations of catastrophes, wars, attacks, diseases, and accidents. If, on one hand, photographic images in mass media emerge as records of daily misfortunes and woes, on the other hand, the ethical implications of photojournalistic practice have shed light on the creation of a large gallery of sufferers transformed into examples of various themes that make up ordinary sufferings. This has been the target of criticism focused on both the exploitation of others' misfortunes and the critical and affective numbness of viewers stimulated by this torrent of images of suffering.

Representative democracy requires, for its functioning, a set of characteristics, which can be understood as institutions. They are: Elected officials; Free, fair and frequent elections; Inclusive suffrage; Right to run for elective office; Freedom of expression; Diversified sources of information; Autonomy for associations. Among the mentioned categories, two stand out as pillars of the democratic regime.
Freedom of expression: citizens have the right to express themselves, without the danger of severe punishments, regarding political matters in general, which includes the freedom to criticize government officials, the government itself, the regime, the socioeconomic order, and the dominant ideology.
Diversified sources of information: citizens have the right to seek alternative, diversified, and independent sources of information. Furthermore, the existence of alternative sources of information must be protected by law.

Constitutional supremacy translates into formal and material superlegality. Formal superlegality identifies the Constitution as the primary source of normative production, dictating competences and procedures for the elaboration of lower normative acts. And material superlegality subordinates the content of all state normative activity to conformity with the principles and rules of the Constitution. The non-compliance with these formal and material prescriptions triggers a mechanism for protecting the Constitution, known among us as constitutional review.

The integrity of the environment cannot be compromised by individual interests, just as strict liability, in the environmental field, guided by the principles of polluter-pays and full reparation, cannot be eluded by the application of the de minimis principle. The jurisprudence of the Superior Court of Justice and the Federal Supreme Court is firm in not allowing the prevalence of defense theses in environmental law that, through oblique means, seek to protect alleged acquired rights to deforestation, nor admit the invocation of the theory of fait accompli as a way to exempt the offender from the duty to promote the recovery of the area affected by human intervention. Otherwise, it would be endorsing that the fundamental, non-negotiable, and intergenerational right to a balanced environment, constitutionally enshrined in Article 225 of the Federal Constitution, could be subjugated to selfish claims. The refusal or partial application of the polluter-pays and full reparation principles risks projecting, morally, the harmful impression that environmental wrongdoing pays off. Therefore, the judicial response, in the case of environmental damage, must be vigorous, under penalty of the offender's impunity serving as social inspiration.

102,29,Law,2022,"Appeal - Minas Gerais Court of Justice
The integrity of the environment cannot be compromised by individual interests, just as strict liability, in the environmental field, guided by the principles of polluter-pays and full reparation, cannot be eluded by the application of the de minimis principle. The jurisprudence of the Superior Court of Justice and the Federal Supreme Court is firm in not allowing the prevalence of defense theses in environmental law that, through oblique means, seek to protect alleged acquired rights to deforestation, nor admit the invocation of the theory of fait accompli as a way to exempt the offender from the duty to promote the recovery of the area affected by human intervention. Otherwise, it would be endorsing that the fundamental, non-negotiable, and intergenerational right to a balanced environment, constitutionally enshrined in Article 225 of the Federal Constitution, could be subjugated to selfish claims. The refusal or partial application of the polluter-pays and full reparation principles risks projecting, morally, the harmful impression that environmental wrongdoing pays off.

108,35,Law,2022,"The concept of transitional justice, considered in the context of International Human Rights Law, as institutional responses to be taken to confront violations of oppressive predecessor regimes, is based on the tripod of truth, memory, and justice. However, this threefold approach was not implemented in Brazil, due to the political choice adopted by the military regime, enshrined in the Amnesty Law (Law 6.683/1979), based on the ideals of forgiveness and forgetting. When judging the Direct Action of Unconstitutionality (ADPF) No. 153 in 2010, the Federal Supreme Court analyzed the constitutionality of the Amnesty Law in light of the 1988 Federal Constitution and expressed the understanding that the decision to enact the Amnesty Law stems from the state sovereignty of the country and, therefore, Brazil would not be obliged to revise it.

Representative democracy requires, for its functioning, a set of characteristics, which can be understood as institutions. They are: Elected officials; Free, fair and frequent elections; Inclusive suffrage; Right to run for elective office; Freedom of expression; Diversified sources of information; Autonomy for associations. Among the mentioned categories, two stand out as pillars of the democratic regime.
Freedom of expression: citizens have the right to express themselves, without the danger of severe punishments, regarding political matters in general, which includes the freedom to criticize government officials, the government itself, the regime, the socioeconomic order, and the dominant ideology.
Diversified sources of information: citizens have the right to seek alternative, diversified, and independent sources of information. Furthermore, the existence of alternative sources of information must be protected by law.

Although political regimes can be overthrown and ideologies criticized and stripped of their legitimacy, behind a regime and its ideology there is always a way of thinking and feeling, a series of cultural habits, a nebula of obscure instincts and unfathomable impulses.

In May 2022, Genivaldo de Jesus Santos was suffocated and killed by tear gas, according to the Forensic Medical Institute report, inside a Federal Highway Police vehicle in the state of Sergipe, after being approached for riding a motorcycle without a helmet. During the police approach, a nephew of the victim informed that he suffered from schizophrenia, had been in treatment for about 20 years, and was taking medication, which, in fact, was in his possession. Even though the police were informed, the approach continued with the use of force and violence, disproportionate to the risk posed by Genivaldo.

TEXT 2
At the beginning of the 20th century, the first eugenic initiatives emerged in the country, whose collective problems were understood from the unwanted proliferation of people who reproduced, over consecutive generations, spreading vicious, criminal, and degenerate behavioral and mental characteristics. Under the altruistic discourse of guaranteeing treatment, the insane-criminal came to be contained and isolated in judicial asylums, institutions linked to the prison system and administered, at the time, by important psychiatrists.
