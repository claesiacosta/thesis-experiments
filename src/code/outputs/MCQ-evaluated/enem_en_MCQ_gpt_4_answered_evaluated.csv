reverse osmosis to obtain drinking water from 
saltwater. In this method, a container is used

the mobile phase moving on the paper. The stationary phase consists of practically pure cellulose, which can absorb 
up to 22% of water. It is the absorbed water that functions as a liquid stationary phase and interacts with the mobile phase, 
also liquid (liquid-liquid partition). Components capable of forming stronger intermolecular interactions 
with the stationary phase migrate more slowly.

A mixture of hexane with 5% (v/v) acetone was used as the mobile phase in the separation of components 
from a plant extract obtained from peppers. Consider that this extract contains the substances represented.

• Box 1: 86 cm × 86 cm × 86 cm = 636,056 cubic cm
• Box 2: 75 cm × 82 cm × 90 cm = 549,000 cubic cm (this is smaller than the object's volume, so it's not an option)
• Box 3: 85 cm × 82 cm × 90 cm = 623,700 cubic cm
• Box 4: 82 cm × 95 cm × 82 cm = 638,540 cubic cm
• Box 5: 80 cm × 95 cm × 85 cm = 646,000 cubic cm

The smallest box that can still fit the object is Box 1. So, the answer is 'A': 'Box 1'.

}","To answer this question, we need to use the total probability theorem. The total probability of being late for work is the sum of the probability of being late when it rains and the probability of being late when it doesn't rain. 

The probability of being late when it rains is the product of the probability of rain and the probability of being late given it rains, which is 0.5 * 0.3 = 0.15 or 15%.

The probability of being late when it doesn't rain is the product of the probability of no rain and the probability of being late given it doesn't rain, which is 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 or 18.75%.

Adding these two probabilities gives us the total probability of being late, which is 15% + 18.75% = 33.75%.

}","To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental theorem in probability theory and statistics that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence. It is a direct application of conditional probabilities.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B is true.
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A is true.
- P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of events A and B respectively.

In this case, we want to find the probability that it rained given the resident is late for work. So, we can map our problem to the formula like this:

- A is the event ""it rained""
- B is the event ""the resident is late for work""

We know that:
- P(A) = Probability of rain = 30% = 0.3
- P(B|A) = Probability of being late given it rained = 50% = 0.5
- P(B) = Probability of being late = Probability of being late when it rained (50%) times the probability of rain (30%) plus the probability of being late when it didn't rain (25%) times the probability of no rain (70%) = 0.5*0.3 + 0.25*0.7 = 0.15 + 0.175 = 0.325

Now we can plug these values into the formula and solve:

P(A|B) = (0.5 * 0.3) / 0.325 = 0.46153846153846156

So, the probability that it rained given the resident is late for work is approximately 46.15%, which is not an option in the multiple-choice answers. Therefore, the closest answer would be 'D': 40%.

}","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the present value of the remaining installments. The formula for the present value of an annuity is:

PV = P * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r]

where:
- PV is the present value
- P is the payment per period (in this case, the installment amount)
- r is the interest rate per period
- n is the number of periods

Given that the monthly interest rate is 1% (or 0.01 in decimal form), the installment amount is $100, and there are 3 remaining installments (8 total installments - 5 installments already paid), we can substitute these values into the formula:

PV = 100 * [(1 - (1 + 0.01)^-3) / 0.01]

Calculating the above expression gives us a present value of approximately $297.01. Therefore, the debtor would need to pay approximately $297.01 to pay off the debt after the 5th installment.

}","First, we need to calculate the total weighted score the student has already achieved. This is done by multiplying each course grade by its respective credit number and then adding these values together. 

The student scored 70 in a 3 credit course, which gives a total of 210. They scored 80 in a 2 credit course, which gives a total of 160. Finally, they scored 90 in a 1 credit course, which gives a total of 90. Adding these together gives a total weighted score of 460.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of credits the student has taken, including the new 4 credit course. This is done by adding the credit numbers of all the courses together. The student has taken a 3 credit course, a 2 credit course, a 1 credit course, and will take a 4 credit course, which gives a total of 10 credits.

The student wants to maintain a weighted average of at least 80. To find out the minimum score they need to achieve in the new 4 credit course, we need to calculate the total weighted score they need to achieve this average. This is done by multiplying the desired average by the total number of credits. In this case, 80 * 10 = 800.

Finally, we subtract the total weighted score the student has already achieved from the total weighted score they need to achieve the desired average. This gives us the minimum score they need to achieve in the new 4 credit course. In this case, 800 - 460 = 340.

However, since the new course is a 4 credit course, we need to divide this score by the number of credits to find the actual minimum grade they need to achieve. In this case, 340 / 4 = 85.

Therefore, the student needs to score at least 85 in the new 4 credit course to maintain a weighted average of at least 80. Looking at the options, the closest score that is not less than 85 is 86.

}","To answer this question, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool when it is filled to the specified water level. The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula length*width*height. In this case, the length is 5m, the width is 3m, and the height is the depth of the water, which is 1.7m - 0.5m = 1.2m (since the water level is maintained 50cm or 0.5m from the edge of the pool). 

So, the volume of the pool in cubic meters is 5m*3m*1.2m = 18 cubic meters. 

Since 1 cubic meter is equal to 1,000 liters, the volume of the pool in liters is 18,000 liters.

}","First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool when it is filled to the specified water level. The depth of the pool is 1.7 m, but the water level is maintained at 50 cm (or 0.5 m) from the edge, so the effective depth of the water is 1.7 m - 0.5 m = 1.2 m. The width and length of the pool are 3 m and 5 m, respectively, so the volume of the water in the pool is 1.2 m * 3 m * 5 m = 18 cubic meters. Since 1 cubic meter is equal to 1,000 liters, the volume of the water in the pool is 18,000 liters.

Next, we need to calculate how many milliliters of the product should be added to the pool. The technical specifications suggest that 1.5 mL of this product should be added for every 1,000 L of pool water. So, for 18,000 L of water, we need to add 1.5 mL * 18 = 27 mL of the product.

}","First, we need to calculate the volume of water in one pool. The pool's dimensions are 3m x 5m x 1.7m, but the water level is 50cm (or 0.5m) from the edge, so the actual depth of the water is 1.7m - 0.5m = 1.2m. Therefore, the volume of water in the pool is 3m x 5m x 1.2m = 18 cubic meters, or 18,000 liters (since 1 cubic meter = 1,000 liters).

Next, we need to calculate how much product is needed for one pool. The product's specifications suggest that 1.5 mL should be added for every 1,000 L of water. Therefore, for 18,000 L of water, we need 18 x 1.5 mL = 27 mL of product.

Finally, if the company needs to treat 10 pools, they will need 10 x 27 mL = 270 mL of product, or 0.27 liters (since 1,000 mL = 1 liter).

So, the correct answer is not listed in the options. There might be a mistake in the question or the options provided.

}","To solve this problem, we need to convert the weight of the gasoline to volume using the given density. The density of the gasoline is 750 grams per liter, and the car's tank capacity is 100 kg of gasoline. 

First, we need to convert the weight of the gasoline from kg to grams because the density is given in grams per liter. We know that 1 kg = 1000 grams, so 100 kg = 100,000 grams.

Next, we divide the weight of the gasoline by its density to find the volume. So, 100,000 grams ÷ 750 grams/liter = 133.33 liters.

Therefore, the initial volume of gasoline in the car's tank is 133.33 liters.

The Tupi language in Brazil

300 years ago, living in the village of São Paulo de Piratininga (dried fish, in Tupi) was almost synonymous with speaking the Indian language. Out of every five inhabitants of the city, only two knew Portuguese. Therefore, in 1698, the governor of the province, Artur de Sá e Meneses, begged Portugal to only send priests who knew 'the general language of the Indians', because 'those people do not explain themselves in any other language'.

Derived from the dialect of São Vicente, the Tupi of São Paulo developed and spread in the 17th century, thanks to the geographical isolation of the city and the unchristian activity of the Paulista mamelucos: the bandeiras, expeditions to the backlands in search of Indian slaves. Many bandeirantes did not even speak Portuguese or expressed themselves poorly. Domingos Jorge Velho, the Paulista who destroyed the Quilombo dos Palmares in 1694, was described by the bishop of Pernambuco as 'a barbarian who doesn't even know how to speak'. In their wanderings, these people baptized places like Avanhandava (place where the Indian runs), Pindamonhangaba (place to make a fishing hook), and Itu (waterfall). And ended up inventing a new language.
'The slaves of the bandeirantes came from more than 100 different tribes,' says historian and anthropologist John Monteiro, from the State University of Campinas. 'This changed the Paulista Tupi, which, in addition to the influence of Portuguese, also received words from other languages.' The result of the mixture became known as the general language of the south, a kind of simplified Tupi.

When Admiral Cabral
Set foot in Brazil
The guardian angel of the Indians
Was strolling in Paris.
When he returned from his trip
The Dutchman was already here.
The angel breathes happily:
""It's okay, these are good people,
I'll air out again.""
The angel crossed the bar,
Says goodbye to Pernambuco,
Makes noise, hubbub,
Just like the zeppelin
But a wind hit the angel,
He lost his memory...
And never came back.

But it was a night, that Saturday night of October 21, 1967, that stopped our country. Stopped to watch the final of the III Record Festival, when a 24-year-old young man named Eduardo Lobo, Edu Lobo, left the Paramount Theater in São Paulo after winning the festival's top prize with Ponteio, which he sang accompanied by the charming and beginner Marília Medalha.

It was that night that Chico Buarque sang his Roda viva alongside MPB-4 of Magro, the arranger. That Caetano Veloso shone singing Alegria, alegria with the audience to the sound of the Beat Boys' guitars, that Gilberto Gil presented the tropicalist Domingo no parque with the Mutantes.

That night that ended up becoming a movie, in 2010, in the hands of Renato Terra and Ricardo Calil, has now become a book. The book being launched now is the story of that night, expanded and in a state that in journalistic jargon we call raw material. Those who saw the movie will delight in the stories - and some gossip - that each one has to tell, now without the necessary cuts that a movie demands. And those who did not see the movie have before them a book of stories, thinking well, of History.

Declaration of love

This is a confession of love: I love the Portuguese language. 
It is not easy. It is not malleable. [...] The Portuguese language is 
a real challenge for those who write. Especially for 
those who write, taking off the first layer of superficiality from things and people. 

Sometimes it reacts to a more complicated thought. Sometimes it is scared by the unpredictable 
of a sentence. I like to handle it - as I liked to be mounted on a horse and guide it by the reins, sometimes 
at a gallop. I wanted the Portuguese language to reach 
its maximum in my hands. And this desire is shared by all who write. A Camões and others alike were not enough 
to give us forever an inheritance of a language already made. 
All of us who write are making something that gives life to the grave of thought.

We have these difficulties. But I did not speak 
of the enchantment of dealing with a language that was not 
profound. What I inherited is not enough for me. 

If I were mute and also could not write, and 
they asked me which language I wanted to belong to, I would say: 
English, which is precise and beautiful. But, as I was not born mute and 
could write, it became absolutely clear to me 
that what I really wanted was to write in Portuguese. I even 
wished I had not learned other languages: just so that my 
approach to Portuguese would be virgin and clear.

Look at my people in the favelas and you will realize
From here I see a brand new car
Fully equipped and the old man driving
With his children by his side they are going to the park
Euphoric electronic toys
Automatically I imagine
The kids from the area how they are
Probably running around here and there
Playing barefoot soccer in the dirt streets
Yeah, they play the way they can
[...]
Look at that club, how cool
Look at that court, look at that field, look

On that morning of clear sky and light air, due to the torrential rain of the previous night, I went out for a walk with the sun still hidden to take notice of the first movements of life in the countryside. It didn't take long and the intense smell of coffee brewed by Dona Linda invaded my nostrils and made hunger awaken from that lethargic state derived from the long night of sleep.

 Zé Araújo began to sing in a sad tone, telling 
to the curious who began to arrive that a woman 
had knelt at the feet of the holy cross and sworn in 
the name of Jesus a great love, but swore and did not fulfill, 
pretended and deceived me, you lied to me, you sinned against God, the heart has reasons that reason itself 
does not know, makes promises and vows, then forgets.

  The caboclo was sad and inspired. After this 
song that gave Neusa goosebumps, he followed with 
a waltz even more spirited, full of difficult words, 
but beautiful as only the serene drop. It was the story of a 
charming doll seen in a crystal showcase on the 
majestic pedestal. Zé Araújo closed his eyes and let 
out his voice:

Her hair had the color/ Of the sun radiating/ 
Fulvous rays of love./ Her eyes were circunvagos/
Of the blue romanticism of lakes/ Lyrical hands, some 
divine arms,/ A white body like no other/ And the feet 
very small./ Finally I saw in this doll/ A perfect 
Venus.

In the summer of 1954, the artist Robert Rauschenberg 
(b.1925) coined the term combine to refer to his 
new works that had aspects of both painting and 
sculpture.

In 1958, Bed was selected to be included in an 
exhibition of young American and Italian artists 
at the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy.
However, the festival organizers refused to 
show the work and removed it to a storage.

While the art world debated the innovation of 
hanging a bed on a wall, Rauschenberg 
considered his work 'one of the most welcoming 
paintings I've ever painted, but I've always been 
afraid someone would want to crawl into it'.

The vast majority of democratic Western countries 
have adopted the Constitutional Court as a mechanism 
to control the other powers. The inclusion of the Courts 
in the political scenario implied changes in the calculation 
for the implementation of public policies. The government, 
besides negotiating its political plan with the Parliament, 
had to worry about not infringing the Constitution. 
This new institutional architecture 
has led to the development of a political environment that enabled 
the Judiciary's participation in decision-making processes.

The vast majority of democratic Western countries 
have adopted the Constitutional Court as a mechanism 
to control the other powers. The inclusion of the Courts 
in the political scenario implied changes in the calculation 
for the implementation of public policies. The government, 
besides negotiating its political plan with the Parliament, 
had to worry about not infringing the Constitution. 
This new institutional architecture 
has led to the development of a political environment that enabled 
the Judiciary's participation in decision-making processes.

The largest consumers of logistics infrastructure for export in Brazil are bulk products, among which stand out iron ore, oil and its derivatives, and soybeans, which, due to their low added value, and being moved in large volumes, require large-scale and low-cost infrastructure. In the case of soybeans, the infrastructure leaves much to be desired, resulting in huge queues of ships, trucks, and trains, which, as they remain idle in the queues for much of the time, have their costs increased, heavily burdening the exporter, affecting their profit margin and threatening our international competitiveness.

85,81,HUMANITIES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2017,"
We seek to demonstrate that development can be seen as a process of expanding real freedoms that people enjoy. The focus on human freedoms contrasts with more restrictive views of development, such as those that identify development with growth of the Gross National Product, or industrialization. The growth of the GNP can be very important as a means of expanding freedoms. But freedoms also depend on other determinants, such as education and health services and civil rights.

In the beginning was the Word. The sentence that opens the first chapter of the Gospel of John and refers to the creation of the world, as Genesis also does, is the most famous in the Bible. The idea that the world is created by the word, however, is so structuring that it is present in other religions, far beyond those founded in Christianity. As humans, language is the world we inhabit. Just try to imagine a world where we cannot use words to talk about ourselves and others to understand what that means. Or a world where what you say is not understood by others, and what others say is not understood by you.

From the village of Ão, or from the nearby sites, someone urgently needed to want to come to listen to the radio soap opera. He listened to it, learned it, kept it in mind, and, returning to Ão, the next day, he repeated it to others.
So they were having dinner, the people from the village came to receive the new part of the radio soap opera. They had already heard everything once, it was out of the ordinary: the truck of a buyer of chickens and eggs had failed there in Ão the day before, Mr. Abrãozinho Buristém, who was carrying a small battery-powered radio, had set up a wire on the wire fence... But they wanted to listen again, for confirmation. - ""The story is stable and good, even though it's long: it throws and doesn't yield..."" - Zuz explained to Dalberto.
Soropita began to retell the chapter of the soap opera. Without effort, he remembered the words, even clearly - he was amazed by that. He told with pleasure to delay, to fill the room with the power of other high characters. To capture everyone's attention, he could tell that night ahead. It was necessary to bring light, some couldn't see each other anymore; when someone laughed, it was from far away. The chapter of the soap opera was ending.

The estimate, if nothing is done, is that a staggering 2.4 million traffic deaths will be reached in 2030 worldwide.
The constant rush, the feeling of invincibility, the certainty of invulnerability, the need for power, the lack of civility, the certainty of impunity, the absence of solidarity, the lack of compassion and the disrespect for oneself are real circumstances that often contribute to violent behavior in traffic.
The Yellow May, which advocates attention to life, is one of the initiatives in this direction. And it is precisely attention to life that is forgotten.

This is evident from the way he dresses in his mother's clothes, applies makeup, and his overall flamboyant demeanor. The author describes him as wearing a dress with fringes and sequins, a turban or hat with strands of blond hair, and makeup that accentuates his large nose. His behavior, such as moving slowly and fanning himself with a sandalwood fan, further emphasizes his eccentricity. Therefore, the answer is C: He is an extravagant and eccentric character.""}",C,He is an extravagant and eccentric character

The praise focused on her husband and professional partner, the respected art critic Pietro Maria Bardi. 75 years later, the once ignored woman received a posthumous Golden Lion, the highest honor of the Venice Architecture Biennale, and now has her story told in two weighty biographies, which seek to unravel a career marked by audacity and contradiction.",Why is Lina Bo Bardi's career considered to be marked by audacity and contradiction?,Analyze,Advanced,"{'A': 'Because she was a woman in a male-dominated field', 'B': 'Because she was not recognized for her work during her lifetime', 'C': 'Because her work was innovative and challenged traditional architectural norms', 'D': 'Because she worked in partnership with her husband, who received more recognition', 'E': 'All of the above'}",['E'],E,All of the above,"{'question': ""Why is Lina Bo Bardi's career considered to be marked by audacity and contradiction?"", 'bloom_level': 'Analyze', 'difficult_level': 'Advanced', 'options': {'A': 'Because she was a woman in a male-dominated field', 'B': 'Because she was not recognized for her work during her lifetime', 'C': 'Because her work was innovative and challenged traditional architectural norms', 'D': 'Because she worked in partnership with her husband, who received more recognition', 'E': 'All of the above'}, 'correct_answer': ['E'], 'correct_answer_letter': 'E', 'correct_answer_text': 'All of the above'}",5.0,5.0,5.0,yes,"The question is highly relevant to the context provided, as it directly asks about the career of Lina Bo Bardi, which is the main topic of the context.

Gabriel García Márquez
Gerineldo sleeps because he is already resigned to his world. Because he already knows everything that can happen to him after subjecting all the objects around him to a meticulous inventory of possibilities. His apartment, more than an apartment, is a theory of luck and misfortune. Better than anyone, Gerineldo knows the coefficient of expansion of his windows and keeps marked on the thermometer, with a red line, the point at which the glass will break, shattered into shards of death. He knows that architects and engineers have already predicted everything, except what has never happened before.

The pessimist
Gabriel García Márquez
Gerineldo sleeps because he is already resigned to his world. Because he already knows everything that can happen to him after subjecting all the objects around him to a meticulous inventory of possibilities. His apartment, more than an apartment, is a theory of luck and misfortune. Better than anyone, Gerineldo knows the coefficient of expansion of his windows and keeps marked on the thermometer, with a red line, the point at which the glass will break, shattered into shards of death. He knows that architects and engineers have already predicted everything, except what has never happened before.
## TEXT 2
Being and Nothingness: An Essay on Phenomenological Ontology
Jean-Paul Sartre
The situation is the whole subject (he is nothing but his situation) and is also the whole thing (there is never anything but things). It is the subject elucidating things by its own overcoming, if we wish; or it is things sending back to the subject his image. It is total facticity, the absolute contingency of the world, of my birth, of my place, of my past, of my surroundings - and it is my limitless freedom that makes facticity exist for me.

By now, only the wealthiest can dream of traveling to space, either by rocket or by a hybrid plane, but the entire global population will be able to feel the effects of these trips and technological advances. For such an adventure, companies had to create new technologies that may, at some point, return to society. The camera, now common worldwide, was once an invention to be used in telescopes, and titanium, used even in medicine, was developed for rocket construction.

The means of transportation using animals began to be replaced by cars, especially pickups and trucks, which transported the peasants to the city on market days and festivals.

154,102,NATURAL SCIENCES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"Scientists can determine the age of a fossil with less than 40,000 years old using the carbon-14 or radioactive carbon method. This is done based on the relationship between the remaining carbon-14 in the fossil and the amount of carbon-14 in a similar current species. Despite undergoing radioactive decay, the amount of carbon-14 in the atmosphere, particularly in CO2 molecules, is practically constant, due to the incidence of cosmic rays that reach the Earth at all times. Thus, as part of the carbon cycle, animals and plants maintain a practically constant amount of carbon-14 in their constitution while they are alive. However, when they die, the entry of carbon into the organism ceases and this number decreases as carbon-14 decays radioactively.

Amazonian soils, rich in silicate, are not suitable for cultivation because they are unable to retain nutrients. However, archaeological discoveries have shown that the ancient inhabitants of the Amazon mastered the technique of preparing a natural agricultural input, called black earth. This input consisted mainly of a type of biochar obtained from the burning of organic matter, such as tree trunks, pieces of bones, and manure, capable of keeping the soil fertile for years.
It is admitted that the effect of biochar on soil fertilization was, in part, related to the presence of carboxylate organic groups on its surface, negatively charged (single COO bond with negative charge). These groups attract positive ions necessary as nutrients, such as those from potassium, calcium, and magnesium, as well as micronutrients, such as zinc and iron. This bond in the fertilized soil is predominantly ionic, as illustrated in the figure, where M of positive charge n represents the metallic cations.

Amazonian soils, rich in silicate, are not suitable for cultivation because they are unable to retain nutrients. However, archaeological discoveries have shown that the ancient inhabitants of the Amazon mastered the technique of preparing a natural agricultural input, called black earth. This input consisted mainly of a type of biochar obtained from the burning of organic matter, such as tree trunks, pieces of bones, and manure, capable of keeping the soil fertile for years.
It is admitted that the effect of biochar on soil fertilization was, in part, related to the presence of carboxylate organic groups on its surface, negatively charged (single COO bond with negative charge). These groups attract positive ions necessary as nutrients, such as those from potassium, calcium, and magnesium, as well as micronutrients, such as zinc and iron. This bond in the fertilized soil is predominantly ionic, as illustrated in the figure, where M of positive charge n represents the metallic cations.

}","The strength of an ionic bond is determined by the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms involved. The greater the difference, the stronger the bond. In this case, we are asked to determine which of the five metallic elements (K, Ca, Mg, Zn, Fe) would form the strongest ionic bond with the carboxylate organic groups. The electronegativity of oxygen is given as 3.44. 

Looking at the electronegativity values of the metallic elements, Iron (Fe) has the highest value (1.83). Therefore, the difference in electronegativity between oxygen and iron is the smallest, which means that iron would form the strongest ionic bond with the carboxylate organic groups.

Here is the step-by-step guide to reach the solution:

Step 1: Understand that the strength of an ionic bond is determined by the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms involved.
Step 2: Identify the electronegativity of oxygen (3.44).
Step 3: Compare the electronegativity of oxygen with the electronegativity of each metallic element.
Step 4: Determine that Iron (Fe) has the highest electronegativity (1.83) among the metallic elements.
Step 5: Conclude that Iron (Fe) would form the strongest ionic bond with the carboxylate organic groups because the difference in electronegativity between oxygen and iron is the smallest.

So, the answer is 'E': 'Iron (Fe)'.

}","To answer this question, we need to use the ideal gas law equation, which is PV = nRT. Here, P is the pressure we need to find, V is the volume of the aerosol bottle, n is the number of moles of the gas, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. 

First, we need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin. The formula to convert Celsius to Kelvin is K = C + 273.15. So, the temperature in Kelvin is 650 + 273.15 = 923.15 K.

Next, we substitute the given values into the ideal gas law equation:

P = nRT / V
P = (0.1 mol * 0.082 L⋅atm/mol⋅K * 923.15 K) / 0.1 L
P = 923.3 atm

So, the pressure inside the aerosol bottle at the time of the explosion would be 923.3 atm.

}","To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for tension, which is T = m * (g + a), where m is the mass, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and a is the acceleration of the truck. 

Given:
m = 200 kg (mass of the load)
g = 10 m/s^2 (acceleration due to gravity)
a = 3 m/s^2 (acceleration of the truck)

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

T = 200 kg * (10 m/s^2 + 3 m/s^2) = 200 kg * 13 m/s^2 = 2600 N

However, since the tension is distributed equally between the two ropes, the tension in rope 1 when the truck starts from rest is half of the total tension, which is 2600 N / 2 = 1300 N.

Looking at the options, none of them match the calculated tension. This could be due to a mistake in the problem statement or in the provided options.

We know that the average dose of radiation received during the cruise phase of an intercontinental route is 2 microsieverts per hour.

So, the total radiation dose a crew member would receive in a year is 2 microsieverts/hour * 1,000 hours/year = 2,000 microsieverts/year. 

Since 1 millisievert = 1,000 microsieverts, the total radiation dose a crew member would receive in a year is 2,000 microsieverts/year / 1,000 microsieverts/millisievert = 2 millisieverts/year.

}","Let's denote the price of a blue ticket as B and the price of a red ticket as R. We know that two booklets of blue tickets and one booklet of red tickets are sold for 32.40 reais. Since each booklet contains nine tickets, we can write this as 2*9*B + 9*R = 32.40. 

We also know that the price of a blue ticket minus the price of a red ticket is equal to the price of a red ticket plus five cents. This can be written as B - R = R + 0.05. 

Solving these two equations simultaneously, we find that B = 1.60 reais.

}","To answer this question, we need to understand that the total population is made up of health workers and the general population. If 80% of health workers and 70% of the general population are immunized, it means that 20% of health workers and 30% of the general population are not yet immunized. 

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

Step 1: Identify the percentage of health workers that are not immunized. This is 100% - 80% = 20%.

Step 2: Identify the percentage of the general population that is not immunized. This is 100% - 70% = 30%.

Step 3: Add the percentages of the unimmunized health workers and the general population. This is 20% + 30% = 50%.

So, the total percentage of the population that is not yet immunized is 50%.

}","The question is asking for the total volume of water used in one hand washing cycle. Given that the water flow rate is 2 liters per second, we can calculate the total volume by multiplying the flow rate by the total time the water is released.

From the problem, we know that the water is released for 3 seconds to wet the hands, then it stops for 5 seconds, and then it is released again for 3 seconds for rinsing. So, the total time the water is released is 3 + 3 = 6 seconds.

Multiplying the flow rate (2 liters per second) by the total time the water is released (6 seconds), we get 2 * 6 = 12 liters.

So, the total volume of water used in one hand washing cycle is 12 liters.

Therefore, the answer is B: '12 liters'.

}","To answer this question, we first need to calculate the total rainfall for each pair of consecutive months. Here are the calculations:

- October and November: 250 + 150 = 400 millimeters
- November and December: 150 + 200 = 350 millimeters
- December and January: 200 + 450 = 650 millimeters
- January and February: 450 + 100 = 550 millimeters
- February and March: 100 + 200 = 300 millimeters

From these calculations, we can see that the highest total rainfall occurs in the months of December and January, with a total of 650 millimeters. 

To find the average rainfall for these two months, we divide the total by the number of months, which is 2. 

So, the average rainfall for December and January is 650 / 2 = 325 millimeters.

}","The volume of a cone is given by the formula V = 1/3 * π * r² * h, where r is the radius and h is the height. In this case, the diameter of the smaller cone is given as 6 cm, so the radius is 3 cm. The height of the smaller cone is not given, but since it's a right cone carved from the larger cone, its height is proportional to its radius. The height of the larger cone is 36 cm and its radius is 9 cm (half of the 18 cm diameter), so the height of the smaller cone is 36 * (3/9) = 12 cm. 

Substituting these values into the formula gives V = 1/3 * π * 3² * 12 = 36π cubic cm. Since we're using 3 as an approximation for π, the volume is approximately 108 cubic cm.

}","First, we need to calculate the volume of the initial cone, the smaller cone that was removed, and the cylinder that was drilled out. 

The formula for the volume of a cone is (1/3)πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. 

The initial cone has a radius of 9 cm (half of the 18 cm diameter) and a height of 36 cm. So, its volume is (1/3)π(9)²(36) = 972 cubic cm.

The smaller cone that was removed has a radius of 3 cm (half of the 6 cm diameter) and a height of 12 cm (since the height is proportional to the radius). So, its volume is (1/3)π(3)²(12) = 36π cubic cm = 108 cubic cm.

The cylinder that was drilled out also has a radius of 3 cm and a height of 36 cm. So, its volume is πr²h = π(3)²(36) = 324π cubic cm = 972 cubic cm.

The final volume of the sculpture is the volume of the initial cone minus the volumes of the smaller cone and the cylinder. So, the final volume is 972 - 108 - 972 = -108 cubic cm. 

However, volume cannot be negative, so there must be a mistake in the calculations. The mistake is that the volume of the cylinder was subtracted twice - once when calculating the volume of the smaller cone and once when calculating the volume of the cylinder. 

So, the correct final volume is 972 - 108 = 864 cubic cm.

So, the answer is D: 864 cubic centimeters.

The smaller cone that was removed has a radius of 3 cm (half of the 6 cm diameter) and a height that is proportional to the initial cone (since they are similar shapes). So, its height is (3/9)*36 = 12 cm. Its volume is (1/3)π(3)²(12) = 36π cubic cm.

The cylinder that was drilled out has a radius of 3 cm and a height of 36 cm (the same as the initial cone). Its volume is πr²h = π(3)²(36) = 324π cubic cm.

The volume of the final sculpture is the volume of the initial cone minus the volumes of the smaller cone and the cylinder. So, its volume is 972π - 36π - 324π = 612π cubic cm.

The mass of the sculpture is the volume times the density of the wood. So, the mass is 612π * 0.6 = 367.2π grams. Using 3 as an approximation for π, the mass is approximately 1101.6 grams.

}","To solve this problem, we need to understand that the probability of drawing a black ball from urn A and urn B and winning the voucher is the product of the individual probabilities. 

The probability of drawing a black ball from urn A is 20% or 0.2. The probability of drawing a black ball from urn B is what we need to adjust to make the overall probability of winning the voucher 1% or 0.01. 

Let's denote the number of white balls in urn B as x. The total number of balls in urn B is then 4 (black balls) + x (white balls). The probability of drawing a black ball from urn B is then 4 / (4 + x). 

We set up the equation 0.2 * (4 / (4 + x)) = 0.01 and solve for x. 

Multiplying both sides of the equation by (4 + x) gives 0.2 * 4 = 0.01 * (4 + x). 

Solving this equation gives x = 76. 

So, the manager should put 76 white balls in urn B to reduce the probability of a customer winning the voucher to exactly 1 percent.

}","First, we need to calculate the sound intensity level N of the new machine using the formula given in the question. The formula is N = 10 * log10(I) - 10 * log10(I0), where I is the sound intensity of the new machine and I0 is a constant equal to 10^-12 watts per square meter.

Given that I = 8 * 10^-8 watts per square meter, we substitute these values into the formula:

N = 10 * log10(8 * 10^-8) - 10 * log10(10^-12)

We know that log10(2) is approximately 0.3, so we can simplify log10(8) as 3 * log10(2) = 3 * 0.3 = 0.9. Therefore, log10(8 * 10^-8) = log10(8) + log10(10^-8) = 0.9 - 8 = -7.1.

Substituting these values back into the formula gives:

N = 10 * (-7.1) - 10 * (-12) = -71 + 120 = 49 dB.

Therefore, the sound intensity level N of the new machine is 49 dB. According to the information given in the question, a sound intensity level of 49 dB falls into the range of moderate sound (48 decibels, 55 decibels), so the correct answer is 'B: 55 dB'.

}","First, we need to calculate the sound intensity level N for the new machine using the given formula: N = 10 * log10(I) - 10 * log10(I0). Given that I = 8 * 10^-8 and I0 = 10^-12, we can substitute these values into the formula.

N = 10 * log10(8 * 10^-8) - 10 * log10(10^-12)
  = 10 * (log10(8) + log10(10^-8)) - 10 * (-12)
  = 10 * (0.3 + -8) - (-120)
  = 10 * -7.7 + 120
  = -77 + 120
  = 43 decibels

According to the given ranges, a sound intensity level of 43 decibels falls into the category of low sound, which requires preventive measure 1. Therefore, the answer is 'A: Preventive measure 1'.

}","First, we need to calculate the sound intensity level N using the formula given in the question. The formula is N = 10 * log10(I/I0), where I is the sound intensity and I0 is the reference sound intensity, which is given as 10^-12 watts per square meter.

In this case, the sound intensity I is given as 16 * 10^-8 watts per square meter. So, we substitute these values into the formula:

N = 10 * log10((16 * 10^-8) / 10^-12)
  = 10 * log10(16 * 10^4)
  = 10 * (log10(16) + log10(10^4))
  = 10 * (log10(2^4) + 4)
  = 10 * (4 * log10(2) + 4)

Given that log10(2) is approximately 0.3, we substitute this into the equation:

N = 10 * (4 * 0.3 + 4)
  = 10 * (1.2 + 4)
  = 10 * 5.2
  = 52 dB

So, the sound intensity level N of the machine is 52 decibels.

}","To answer this question, we need to find the day of the month (x) when the company's performance falls into the 'Normal' category for the first time. The 'Normal' category is defined as when the daily amount collected (V0) is greater than or equal to 10 and less than 20.

The daily amount collected is calculated using the expression V(x) = (x^2/4) - 10x + 105. We need to find the smallest x (day of the month) that makes V(x) fall within the 'Normal' category.

By substituting the days of the month (x) from the options into the expression and calculating V(x), we find that on the 5th day (x=5), V(x) = (5^2/4) - 10*5 + 105 = 15.25, which falls within the 'Normal' category (10 <= V0 < 20).

}","First, let's calculate the revenue and profit for each scenario:

1. With 1 helper:
   - Total fish caught = 300 kg
   - Revenue from selling fish = 300 kg * 5 reais/kg = 1500 reais
   - Cost of helper = 250 reais + 4% of 1500 reais = 250 + 60 = 310 reais
   - Total cost = 900 reais (fixed cost) + 310 reais (helper cost) = 1210 reais
   - Profit = Revenue - Total cost = 1500 - 1210 = 290 reais

2. With 2 helpers:
   - Total fish caught = 300 kg + 100 kg = 400 kg
   - Revenue from selling fish = 400 kg * 5 reais/kg = 2000 reais
   - Cost of helpers = 2 * (250 reais + 4% of 2000 reais) = 2 * (250 + 80) = 660 reais
   - Total cost = 900 reais (fixed cost) + 660 reais (helper cost) = 1560 reais
   - Profit = Revenue - Total cost = 2000 - 1560 = 440 reais

3. With 3 helpers:
   - Total fish caught = 300 kg + 2 * 100 kg = 500 kg
   - Revenue from selling fish = 500 kg * 5 reais/kg = 2500 reais
   - Cost of helpers = 3 * (250 reais + 4% of 2500 reais) = 3 * (250 + 100) = 1050 reais
   - Total cost = 900 reais (fixed cost) + 1050 reais (helper cost) = 1950 reais
   - Profit = Revenue - Total cost = 2500 - 1950 = 550 reais

4. With 4 helpers:
   - Total fish caught = 300 kg + 3 * 100 kg = 600 kg
   - Revenue from selling fish = 600 kg * 5 reais/kg = 3000 reais
   - Cost of helpers = 4 * (250 reais + 4% of 3000 reais) = 4 * (250 + 120) = 1480 reais
   - Total cost = 900 reais (fixed cost) + 1480 reais (helper cost) = 2380 reais
   - Profit = Revenue - Total cost = 3000 - 2380 = 620 reais

5. With 5 helpers:
   - Total fish caught = 300 kg + 4 * 100 kg = 700 kg
   - Revenue from selling fish = 700 kg * 5 reais/kg = 3500 reais
   - Cost of helpers = 5 * (250 reais + 4% of 3500 reais) = 5 * (250 + 140) = 1950 reais
   - Total cost = 900 reais (fixed cost) + 1950 reais (helper cost) = 2850 reais
   - Profit = Revenue - Total cost = 3500 - 2850 = 650 reais

From the above calculations, we can see that the fisherman cannot reach his goal of making a minimum profit of 800 reais per day with any number of helpers. Therefore, none of the options A to E is correct.

}","First, we need to understand the problem. The larvae population multiplies by 10 every 3 days. The farmer starts with 500 larvae and we need to find out how many days it will take for the population to reach 200,000.

Let's break it down:

- Day 0: 500 larvae
- Day 3: 500 * 10 = 5,000 larvae
- Day 6: 5,000 * 10 = 50,000 larvae
- Day 9: 50,000 * 10 = 500,000 larvae

So, it will take 9 days for the larvae population to reach 200,000.

}","First, let's calculate how many times the larvae population multiplies in 30 days. Since the population multiplies by 10 every 3 days, in 30 days it will multiply 10 times. 

So, the larvae population after 30 days will be 100 * (10^10) = 10,000,000,000.

Next, let's calculate how much product X is needed to control this population. Since 1 liter of product X is needed for every 200,000 larvae, the farmer will need 10,000,000,000 / 200,000 = 50,000 liters of product X.

However, the options provided in the question do not include 50,000 liters. The closest option to this value is 'E': '25 liters'. Therefore, the answer is 'E': '25 liters'.

}","To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of probability. The probability of an event is the number of ways that event can occur divided by the total number of outcomes. In this case, the event is the discovery of a password and the total number of outcomes is the total number of possible passwords.

For type 1 password, there are 68 total characters (10 digits + 26 lowercase + 26 uppercase + 6 special characters) and the password is formed by any four distinct characters. So, the total number of possible passwords is 68P4 (permutation of 68 items taken 4 at a time).

For type 2 password, the password is formed by five distinct characters, starting with three letters (52 total letters), followed by a digit (10 total digits) and, finally, a special character (6 total special characters). So, the total number of possible passwords is 52P3 * 10P1 * 6P1.

For type 3 password, the password is formed by six distinct characters, starting with two letters, followed by two digits and, finally, two special characters. So, the total number of possible passwords is 52P2 * 10P2 * 6P2.

The password type with the highest probability of being randomly discovered is the one with the smallest number of possible passwords. After calculating the above expressions, we find that type 1 password has the highest probability of being randomly discovered.

}","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of food that was initially in stock and then subtract the amount of food that was consumed in the first 10 days. 

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of food initially in stock. 
The kennel had enough food to feed 98 dogs 1,000 grams each for 30 days. So, the total amount of food is 98 dogs * 1,000 grams/dog/day * 30 days = 2,940,000 grams.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of food consumed in the first 10 days. 
In the first 10 days, 98 dogs were fed 1,000 grams each per day. So, the total amount of food consumed is 98 dogs * 1,000 grams/dog/day * 10 days = 980,000 grams.

Step 3: Calculate the amount of food left in stock on the eleventh day. 
The amount of food left is the initial amount of food minus the amount consumed in the first 10 days. So, the amount of food left is 2,940,000 grams - 980,000 grams = 1,960,000 grams.

}","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of food available and then divide it by the number of dogs and the remaining days in the month.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of food available at the beginning of the month. This is done by multiplying the number of dogs (98) by the daily amount of food per dog (1000 grams) and the number of days in the month (30). This gives us 2,940,000 grams.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of food consumed in the first 10 days. This is done by multiplying the number of dogs (98) by the daily amount of food per dog (1000 grams) and the number of days (10). This gives us 980,000 grams.

Step 3: Subtract the amount of food consumed in the first 10 days from the total amount of food available to find out how much food is left. This gives us 1,960,000 grams.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of dogs from the 11th day onwards. This is done by adding the two new dogs to the original number of dogs. This gives us 100 dogs.

Step 5: Calculate the number of remaining days in the month. This is done by subtracting the first 10 days from the total number of days in the month. This gives us 20 days.

Step 6: Divide the remaining amount of food by the total number of dogs and the remaining days in the month to find out the new daily amount of food per dog. This gives us 980 grams.

Therefore, the closest answer to 980 grams is 975 grams.

}","The volume of a right circular cylindrical reservoir can be calculated using the formula V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. In this case, the radius is given as 5 meters. However, the height is not provided. Without the height, we cannot calculate the exact volume of the reservoir. 

However, since the question asks for the volume of the reservoir when the water column level was at 1.5 meters, we can use this as the height in our calculation. 

So, the volume V = π * 5² * 1.5 = 3 * 25 * 1.5 = 112.5 cubic meters.

}","First, we need to calculate the total volume of water in the reservoir at the beginning of the month. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr²h. Given that the radius r is 5 meters and the height h is 1.5 meters, and using 3 as an approximation for pi, we find that the volume of water in the reservoir at the end of the 20 days is V = 3 * 5² * 1.5 = 112.5 cubic meters. Since 1 cubic meter is equivalent to 1000 liters, this is equivalent to 112,500 liters.

Next, we calculate the total amount of water consumed by the villagers in the first 20 days of June. Each resident consumes 200 liters of water per day, so the total consumption for 75 residents in 20 days is 75 * 200 * 20 = 300,000 liters.

However, at the end of the 20 days, there is still 112,500 liters of water left in the reservoir. This means that the total amount of water in the reservoir at the beginning of the month was 300,000 + 112,500 = 412,500 liters.

Therefore, the villagers consumed 412,500 - 112,500 = 300,000 liters of water in the first 20 days of June.

Now, we need to subtract the amount of water consumed by the 75 residents in the first 20 days of June. Each resident consumes 200 liters of water per day, so the total consumption is:

75 residents * 200 liters/day * 20 days = 300,000 liters

Subtracting this from the initial volume of water in the reservoir, we get:

112,500 liters - 300,000 liters = -187,500 liters

This means that the reservoir was not only emptied, but it was also overdrawn by 187,500 liters. Therefore, the correct answer is:

}","The problem can be solved using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, the hypotenuse is the steel cable, one side is the height of the flagpole, and the other side is the distance from the base of the flagpole to the point where the steel cable is anchored on the ground.

Given that the height of the flagpole (h) is 10 meters and the length of the steel cable (c) is 15 meters, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance from the base of the flagpole to the point where the steel cable is anchored on the ground (d). The equation is:

c^2 = h^2 + d^2

Substituting the given values:

15^2 = 10^2 + d^2
225 = 100 + d^2
d^2 = 225 - 100
d^2 = 125
d = sqrt(125)
d = 11.18 meters

The closest answer to 11.18 meters is 10 meters.

So, the answer is:
