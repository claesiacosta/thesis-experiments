Representative democracy requires, for its functioning, a set of characteristics, which can be understood as institutions. They are: Elected officials; Free, fair and frequent elections; Inclusive suffrage; Right to run for elective office; Freedom of expression; Diversified sources of information; Autonomy for associations. Among the mentioned categories, two stand out as pillars of the democratic regime.
Freedom of expression: citizens have the right to express themselves, without the danger of severe punishments, regarding political matters in general, which includes the freedom to criticize government officials, the government itself, the regime, the socioeconomic order, and the dominant ideology.
Diversified sources of information: citizens have the right to seek alternative, diversified, and independent sources of information. Furthermore, the existence of alternative sources of information must be protected by law.

The art occupies the side space of two floors of a building, characterized by the intense use of contrasts and colors that portrays a man sitting on the ground, head down, barefoot, with two empty plates by his side and holding a sign that reads 'Welcome to real Brazil'.
Initially, the transgressive nature of graffiti was seen by the State as vandalism in public space and as a danger to the conservation of private property, therefore, it should be combated. Over time, however, this marginal conception has transformed, leading to an acceptable valorization by the State and positive for society. This transition of graffiti, from marginal art to recognized and accepted artistic expression, has revealed important aspects not only for graffiti professionals, but for society as a whole, as it incorporates the possibility of being an artistic product of cultural, economic, and ideological value.

These activities were based on the rational division of labor, on the requirement of specialization and differentiation of the functions performed by workers, and classified according to technical criteria, through subordination to a hierarchically organized and highly specialized authority.

The binomial 'innovative idea + technology' is not the unequivocal key to success, why? The key issue is the 'business model', which can be translated as the element that connects what technology provides and what the market wants. A new technology that does not have a specific business model must know how to extract value from technological innovation. Therefore, the entrepreneur needs to structure his business model well, understanding how various resources interact, often in a complex way, and how the company can create and capture value from this interaction. In the tourism segment, for example, many people do not have the expertise or time to consult hotels on the internet or to enter a flight search site. For them, it is better to go to an agency. Innovative business models that have emerged in this segment have modified the market structure, and past travel agencies whose business core was the average customer have fallen by the wayside. With this, new business models focused on specific niches (for example, popular tourism) or customized products (for example, Safari in Namibia) have emerged.

The proposal was to use what they called 'Net Performance Promoters Score (NPPS)' or 'Net Performance Promoters Score (ELPD)', with evaluation based on three questions for each worker/employee: 1) What is the likelihood that you would recommend this organization as a workplace to friends or relatives?, with responses restricted to a 10-point scale, with extremes of 1 (indicating very unlikely) and 10 (indicating very likely); 2) Why did you indicate this score?, with an open-ended response; 3) What could be done for you to increase your score by 1 point?, with an open-ended response. Regarding the first question, respondents who indicated from 1 to 6 would be categorized as 'detractors', those who indicated 9 or 10 would be categorized as 'promoters', and the others would be categorized as 'passives'. The ELPD is defined as the difference between the percentage of promoters and the percentage of detractors. According to the proposal, it is a convenient, practical, relevant, and useful metric for measuring staff performance in times of crisis, and it may be useful after the end of the pandemic.

Representative democracy requires, for its functioning, a set of characteristics, which can be understood as institutions. They are: Elected officials; Free, fair and frequent elections; Inclusive suffrage; Right to run for elective office; Freedom of expression; Diversified sources of information; Autonomy for associations. Among the mentioned categories, two stand out as pillars of the democratic regime.
Freedom of expression: citizens have the right to express themselves, without the danger of severe punishments, regarding political matters in general, which includes the freedom to criticize government officials, the government itself, the regime, the socioeconomic order, and the dominant ideology.
Diversified sources of information: citizens have the right to seek alternative, diversified, and independent sources of information. Furthermore, the existence of alternative sources of information must be protected by law.

On June 20, 2022, the news website The Intercept Brazil, in partnership with the portal Catarinas, published a story denouncing that an 11-year-old girl, pregnant after being a victim of rape, had been kept by the Justice of Santa Catarina in a shelter for over a month, in order to prevent her from having a legal abortion. According to the story, published using text and video, the girl was taken to the hospital by her mother to undergo the procedure two days after the pregnancy was discovered. Although the Penal Code allows abortion in cases of sexual violence, the medical team refused to perform the procedure. The girl was then sent to the shelter by the court, under the justification that there was a risk that the mother would take some action to end the baby's life. The report shows video excerpts of the victim's mother's testimony (image below) and the girl herself. The case had wide media coverage and the same excerpts of the testimonies were reproduced on several newscasts.

Representative democracy requires, for its functioning, a set of characteristics, which can be understood as institutions. They are: Elected officials; Free, fair and frequent elections; Inclusive suffrage; Right to run for elective office; Freedom of expression; Diversified sources of information; Autonomy for associations. Among the mentioned categories, two stand out as pillars of the democratic regime.
Freedom of expression: citizens have the right to express themselves, without the danger of severe punishments, regarding political matters in general, which includes the freedom to criticize government officials, the government itself, the regime, the socioeconomic order, and the dominant ideology.
Diversified sources of information: citizens have the right to seek alternative, diversified, and independent sources of information. Furthermore, the existence of alternative sources of information must be protected by law.

}","To answer this question, we need to calculate the acceptance rate of asylum applications in Brazil. This can be done by dividing the number of refugees recognized by the country (60,011) by the total number of applications (297,712) and multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.

The calculation is as follows: (60,011 / 297,712) * 100 = 20.15%

So, the acceptance rate is about 20%.

Representative democracy requires, for its functioning, a set of characteristics, which can be understood as institutions. They are: Elected officials; Free, fair and frequent elections; Inclusive suffrage; Right to run for elective office; Freedom of expression; Diversified sources of information; Autonomy for associations. Among the mentioned categories, two stand out as pillars of the democratic regime.
Freedom of expression: citizens have the right to express themselves, without the danger of severe punishments, regarding political matters in general, which includes the freedom to criticize government officials, the government itself, the regime, the socioeconomic order, and the dominant ideology.
Diversified sources of information: citizens have the right to seek alternative, diversified, and independent sources of information. Furthermore, the existence of alternative sources of information must be protected by law.

The art occupies the side space of two floors of a building, characterized by the intense use of contrasts and colors depicting a man sitting on the ground, head down, barefoot, with two empty plates beside him and holding a sign that reads 'Welcome to real Brazil'.
Initially, the transgressive nature of graffiti was seen by the State as vandalism in public space and as a danger to the conservation of private property, therefore, it should be combated. Over time, however, this marginal conception has transformed, leading to an acceptable valorization by the State and positive for society.
