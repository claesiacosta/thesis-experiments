There are, as is known, two candidates for the presidency, 
Mr. Eduardo Gomes and Eurico Dutra, and a third, 
Mr. Getúlio Vargas, who must be a candidate of some 
hidden political group, but is also the popular candidate. 
Because there are two “we want”: the “we want” of those 
who want to see if they continue in their positions and the popular “we want”... After all, what is Mr. Getúlio Vargas? 
Is he a fascist? Is he a communist? Is he an atheist? Is he a Christian? Does he want to leave? 
Does he want to stay? However, the people seem to like him 
precisely because he is “in the style of the house”.

To comply with current environmental standards, construction companies need to anticipate in their works the issue of using materials in order to minimize the impacts caused on site. Among these materials is the so-called concregram or pisogram, which is a type of coating composed of concrete pieces with empty areas filled with grass soil.

The largest consumers of logistics infrastructure for export in Brazil are bulk products, among which stand out iron ore, oil and its derivatives, and soybeans, which, due to their low added value, and being moved in large volumes, require large-scale and low-cost infrastructure. In the case of soybeans, the infrastructure leaves much to be desired, resulting in huge queues of ships, trucks, and trains, which, as they remain idle in the queues for much of the time, have their costs increased, heavily burdening the exporter, affecting their profit margin and threatening our international competitiveness.

104,NATURAL SCIENCES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"## Ancient Soil Chemists of the Amazon
Amazonian soils, rich in silicate, are not suitable for cultivation because they are unable to retain nutrients. However, archaeological discoveries have shown that the ancient inhabitants of the Amazon mastered the technique of preparing a natural agricultural input, called black earth. This input consisted mainly of a type of biochar obtained from the burning of organic matter, such as tree trunks, pieces of bones, and manure, capable of keeping the soil fertile for years.
It is admitted that the effect of biochar on soil fertilization was, in part, related to the presence of carboxylate organic groups on its surface, negatively charged (single COO bond with negative charge). These groups attract positive ions necessary as nutrients, such as those from potassium, calcium, and magnesium, as well as micronutrients, such as zinc and iron. This bond in the fertilized soil is predominantly ionic, as illustrated in the figure, where M of positive charge n represents the metallic cations. According to the Pauling scale, the electronegativity of the oxygen element is equal to 3.44.
[[placeholder]]
The table presents the electronegativity values of these five metallic elements.

}","To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental theorem in probability theory and statistics that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence. It is a direct application of conditional probabilities.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B is true.
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A is true.
- P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of events A and B respectively.

In this case, we want to find the probability that it rained given the resident is late for work. So, we can map our problem to the formula like this:

- A is the event ""it rained""
- B is the event ""the resident is late for work""

We know that:
- P(A) = Probability of rain = 30% = 0.3
- P(B|A) = Probability of being late given it rained = 50% = 0.5
- P(B) = Probability of being late = Probability of being late when it rained (50%) times the probability of rain (30%) plus the probability of being late when it didn't rain (25%) times the probability of no rain (70%) = 0.5*0.3 + 0.25*0.7 = 0.15 + 0.175 = 0.325

Now we can plug these values into the formula and solve:

P(A|B) = (0.5 * 0.3) / 0.325 = 0.46153846153846156

So, the probability that it rained given the resident is late for work is approximately 46.15%, which is not an option in the multiple-choice answers. Therefore, the closest answer would be 'D': 40%.

}","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the present value of the remaining installments. The formula for the present value of an annuity is:

where:
- PV is the present value
- P is the payment per period (in this case, the installment amount)
- r is the interest rate per period
- n is the number of periods

Given that the monthly interest rate is 1% (or 0.01 in decimal form), the installment amount is $100, and there are 3 remaining installments (8 total installments - 5 installments already paid), we can substitute these values into the formula:

PV = 100 * [(1 - (1 + 0.01)^-3) / 0.01]

Calculating the above expression gives us a present value of approximately $297.01. Therefore, the debtor would need to pay approximately $297.01 to pay off the debt after the 5th installment.

}","First, we need to calculate the total weighted score the student has already achieved. This is done by multiplying each course grade by its respective credit number and then adding these values together. 

The student scored 70 in a 3 credit course, which gives a total of 210. They scored 80 in a 2 credit course, which gives a total of 160. Finally, they scored 90 in a 1 credit course, which gives a total of 90. Adding these together gives a total weighted score of 460.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of credits the student has taken, including the new 4 credit course. This is done by adding the credit numbers of all the courses together. The student has taken a 3 credit course, a 2 credit course, a 1 credit course, and will take a 4 credit course, which gives a total of 10 credits.

The student wants to maintain a weighted average of at least 80. To find out the minimum score they need to achieve in the new 4 credit course, we need to calculate the total weighted score they need to achieve this average. This is done by multiplying the desired average by the total number of credits. In this case, 80 * 10 = 800.

Finally, we subtract the total weighted score the student has already achieved from the total weighted score they need to achieve the desired average. This gives us the minimum score they need to achieve in the new 4 credit course. In this case, 800 - 460 = 340.

However, since the new course is a 4 credit course, we need to divide this score by the number of credits to find the actual minimum grade they need to achieve. In this case, 340 / 4 = 85.

Therefore, the student needs to score at least 85 in the new 4 credit course to maintain a weighted average of at least 80. Looking at the options, the closest score that is not less than 85 is 86.

The pool's dimensions are 3m x 5m x 1.7m, but the water level is 50cm (or 0.5m) from the edge, so the actual depth of the water is 1.7m - 0.5m = 1.2m. Therefore, the volume of water in the pool is 3m x 5m x 1.2m = 18 cubic meters, or 18,000 liters (since 1 cubic meter = 1,000 liters).

Next, we need to calculate how much product is needed for one pool. The product's specifications suggest that 1.5 mL should be added for every 1,000 L of water. Therefore, for 18,000 L of water, we need 18 x 1.5 mL = 27 mL of product.

Finally, if the company needs to treat 10 pools, they will need 10 x 27 mL = 270 mL of product, or 0.27 liters (since 1,000 mL = 1 liter).

So, the correct answer is not listed in the options. There might be a mistake in the question or the options provided.

104,NATURAL SCIENCES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"## Ancient Soil Chemists of the Amazon
Amazonian soils, rich in silicate, are not suitable for cultivation because they are unable to retain nutrients. However, archaeological discoveries have shown that the ancient inhabitants of the Amazon mastered the technique of preparing a natural agricultural input, called black earth. This input consisted mainly of a type of biochar obtained from the burning of organic matter, such as tree trunks, pieces of bones, and manure, capable of keeping the soil fertile for years.
It is admitted that the effect of biochar on soil fertilization was, in part, related to the presence of carboxylate organic groups on its surface, negatively charged (single COO bond with negative charge). These groups attract positive ions necessary as nutrients, such as those from potassium, calcium, and magnesium, as well as micronutrients, such as zinc and iron. This bond in the fertilized soil is predominantly ionic, as illustrated in the figure, where M of positive charge n represents the metallic cations. According to the Pauling scale, the electronegativity of the oxygen element is equal to 3.44.

Step 1: Understand that the strength of an ionic bond is determined by the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms involved.
Step 2: Identify the electronegativity of oxygen (3.44).

}","To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for tension, which is T = m * (g + a), where m is the mass, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and a is the acceleration of the truck. 

Given:
m = 200 kg (mass of the load)
g = 10 m/s^2 (acceleration due to gravity)
a = 3 m/s^2 (acceleration of the truck)

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

T = 200 kg * (10 m/s^2 + 3 m/s^2) = 200 kg * 13 m/s^2 = 2600 N

If 80% of health workers and 70% of the general population are immunized, it means that 20% of health workers and 30% of the general population are not yet immunized. 

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

Step 1: Identify the percentage of health workers that are not immunized. This is 100% - 80% = 20%.

Step 2: Identify the percentage of the general population that is not immunized. This is 100% - 70% = 30%.

Step 3: Add the percentages of the unimmunized health workers and the general population. This is 20% + 30% = 50%.

}","The question is asking for the total volume of water used in one hand washing cycle. Given that the water flow rate is 2 liters per second, we can calculate the total volume by multiplying the flow rate by the total time the water is released.

From the problem, we know that the water is released for 3 seconds to wet the hands, then it stops for 5 seconds, and then it is released again for 3 seconds for rinsing. So, the total time the water is released is 3 + 3 = 6 seconds.

Multiplying the flow rate (2 liters per second) by the total time the water is released (6 seconds), we get 2 * 6 = 12 liters.

}","The volume of a cone is given by the formula V = 1/3 * π * r² * h, where r is the radius and h is the height. In this case, the diameter of the smaller cone is given as 6 cm, so the radius is 3 cm. The height of the smaller cone is not given, but since it's a right cone carved from the larger cone, its height is proportional to its radius. The height of the larger cone is 36 cm and its radius is 9 cm (half of the 18 cm diameter), so the height of the smaller cone is 36 * (3/9) = 12 cm. 

Substituting these values into the formula gives V = 1/3 * π * 3² * 12 = 36π cubic cm. Since we're using 3 as an approximation for π, the volume is approximately 108 cubic cm.

So, the answer is C: 108 cubic centimeters.

}","First, we need to calculate the volume of the initial cone, the smaller cone that was removed, and the cylinder that was drilled out. 

The formula for the volume of a cone is (1/3)πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. 

The initial cone has a radius of 9 cm (half of the 18 cm diameter) and a height of 36 cm. So, its volume is (1/3)π(9)²(36) = 972 cubic cm.

The smaller cone that was removed has a radius of 3 cm (half of the 6 cm diameter) and a height of 12 cm (since the height is proportional to the radius). So, its volume is (1/3)π(3)²(12) = 36π cubic cm = 108 cubic cm.

The cylinder that was drilled out also has a radius of 3 cm and a height of 36 cm. So, its volume is πr²h = π(3)²(36) = 324π cubic cm = 972 cubic cm.

The final volume of the sculpture is the volume of the initial cone minus the volumes of the smaller cone and the cylinder. So, the final volume is 972 - 108 - 972 = -108 cubic cm. 

However, volume cannot be negative, so there must be a mistake in the calculations. The mistake is that the volume of the cylinder was subtracted twice - once when calculating the volume of the smaller cone and once when calculating the volume of the cylinder. 

So, the correct final volume is 972 - 108 = 864 cubic cm.

So, the answer is D: 864 cubic centimeters.

The probability of drawing a black ball from urn A is 20% or 0.2. The probability of drawing a black ball from urn B is what we need to adjust to make the overall probability of winning the voucher 1% or 0.01. 

Let's denote the number of white balls in urn B as x. The total number of balls in urn B is then 4 (black balls) + x (white balls). The probability of drawing a black ball from urn B is then 4 / (4 + x).

Multiplying both sides of the equation by (4 + x) gives 0.2 * 4 = 0.01 * (4 + x).

Given that I = 8 * 10^-8 watts per square meter, we substitute these values into the formula:

N = 10 * log10(8 * 10^-8) - 10 * log10(10^-12)

We know that log10(2) is approximately 0.3, so we can simplify log10(8) as 3 * log10(2) = 3 * 0.3 = 0.9. Therefore, log10(8 * 10^-8) = log10(8) + log10(10^-8) = 0.9 - 8 = -7.1.

Substituting these values back into the formula gives:

In this case, the sound intensity I is given as 16 * 10^-8 watts per square meter. So, we substitute these values into the formula:

N = 10 * log10((16 * 10^-8) / 10^-12)
  = 10 * log10(16 * 10^4)
  = 10 * (log10(16) + log10(10^4))

Given that log10(2) is approximately 0.3, we substitute this into the equation:

N = 10 * (4 * 0.3 + 4)

1. With 1 helper:
   - Total fish caught = 300 kg
   - Revenue from selling fish = 300 kg * 5 reais/kg = 1500 reais
   - Cost of helper = 250 reais + 4% of 1500 reais = 250 + 60 = 310 reais
   - Total cost = 900 reais (fixed cost) + 310 reais (helper cost) = 1210 reais
   - Profit = Revenue - Total cost = 1500 - 1210 = 290 reais

2. With 2 helpers:
   - Total fish caught = 300 kg + 100 kg = 400 kg
   - Revenue from selling fish = 400 kg * 5 reais/kg = 2000 reais
   - Cost of helpers = 2 * (250 reais + 4% of 2000 reais) = 2 * (250 + 80) = 660 reais
   - Total cost = 900 reais (fixed cost) + 660 reais (helper cost) = 1560 reais
   - Profit = Revenue - Total cost = 2000 - 1560 = 440 reais

3. With 3 helpers:
   - Total fish caught = 300 kg + 2 * 100 kg = 500 kg
   - Revenue from selling fish = 500 kg * 5 reais/kg = 2500 reais
   - Cost of helpers = 3 * (250 reais + 4% of 2500 reais) = 3 * (250 + 100) = 1050 reais
   - Total cost = 900 reais (fixed cost) + 1050 reais (helper cost) = 1950 reais
   - Profit = Revenue - Total cost = 2500 - 1950 = 550 reais

4. With 4 helpers:
   - Total fish caught = 300 kg + 3 * 100 kg = 600 kg
   - Revenue from selling fish = 600 kg * 5 reais/kg = 3000 reais
   - Cost of helpers = 4 * (250 reais + 4% of 3000 reais) = 4 * (250 + 120) = 1480 reais
   - Total cost = 900 reais (fixed cost) + 1480 reais (helper cost) = 2380 reais
   - Profit = Revenue - Total cost = 3000 - 2380 = 620 reais

5. With 5 helpers:
   - Total fish caught = 300 kg + 4 * 100 kg = 700 kg
   - Revenue from selling fish = 700 kg * 5 reais/kg = 3500 reais
   - Cost of helpers = 5 * (250 reais + 4% of 3500 reais) = 5 * (250 + 140) = 1950 reais
   - Total cost = 900 reais (fixed cost) + 1950 reais (helper cost) = 2850 reais
   - Profit = Revenue - Total cost = 3500 - 2850 = 650 reais

}","First, we need to understand the problem. The larvae population multiplies by 10 every 3 days. The farmer starts with 500 larvae and we need to find out how many days it will take for the population to reach 200,000.

Let's break it down:

- Day 0: 500 larvae
- Day 3: 500 * 10 = 5,000 larvae
- Day 6: 5,000 * 10 = 50,000 larvae
- Day 9: 50,000 * 10 = 500,000 larvae

So, it will take 9 days for the larvae population to reach 200,000.

Therefore, the answer is 'B': '9 days'.

}","First, let's calculate how many times the larvae population multiplies in 30 days. Since the population multiplies by 10 every 3 days, in 30 days it will multiply 10 times.

}","To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of probability. The probability of an event is the number of ways that event can occur divided by the total number of outcomes. In this case, the event is the discovery of a password and the total number of outcomes is the total number of possible passwords.

For type 1 password, there are 68 total characters (10 digits + 26 lowercase + 26 uppercase + 6 special characters) and the password is formed by any four distinct characters. So, the total number of possible passwords is 68P4 (permutation of 68 items taken 4 at a time).

For type 2 password, the password is formed by five distinct characters, starting with three letters (52 total letters), followed by a digit (10 total digits) and, finally, a special character (6 total special characters). So, the total number of possible passwords is 52P3 * 10P1 * 6P1.

For type 3 password, the password is formed by six distinct characters, starting with two letters, followed by two digits and, finally, two special characters. So, the total number of possible passwords is 52P2 * 10P2 * 6P2.

The password type with the highest probability of being randomly discovered is the one with the smallest number of possible passwords. After calculating the above expressions, we find that type 1 password has the highest probability of being randomly discovered.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of food initially in stock.

}","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of food available and then divide it by the number of dogs and the remaining days in the month.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of food available at the beginning of the month. This is done by multiplying the number of dogs (98) by the daily amount of food per dog (1000 grams) and the number of days in the month (30). This gives us 2,940,000 grams.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of food consumed in the first 10 days. This is done by multiplying the number of dogs (98) by the daily amount of food per dog (1000 grams) and the number of days (10). This gives us 980,000 grams.

Step 3: Subtract the amount of food consumed in the first 10 days from the total amount of food available to find out how much food is left. This gives us 1,960,000 grams.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of dogs from the 11th day onwards. This is done by adding the two new dogs to the original number of dogs. This gives us 100 dogs.

Step 5: Calculate the number of remaining days in the month. This is done by subtracting the first 10 days from the total number of days in the month. This gives us 20 days.

Step 6: Divide the remaining amount of food by the total number of dogs and the remaining days in the month to find out the new daily amount of food per dog. This gives us 980 grams.

The number of cards with the names of first-year students is 200. So, the probability that a first-year student's name will be drawn is the number of first-year student cards divided by the total number of cards, which is 200/800 = 1/4.

Since 1 cubic meter is equivalent to 1000 liters, this is equivalent to 112,500 liters.

Next, we calculate the total amount of water consumed by the villagers in the first 20 days of June. Each resident consumes 200 liters of water per day, so the total consumption for 75 residents in 20 days is 75 * 200 * 20 = 300,000 liters.

However, at the end of the 20 days, there is still 112,500 liters of water left in the reservoir. This means that the total amount of water in the reservoir at the beginning of the month was 300,000 + 112,500 = 412,500 liters.

}","The problem can be solved using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, the hypotenuse is the steel cable, one side is the height of the flagpole, and the other side is the distance from the base of the flagpole to the point where the steel cable is anchored on the ground.

Given that the height of the flagpole (h) is 10 meters and the length of the steel cable (c) is 15 meters, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance from the base of the flagpole to the point where the steel cable is anchored on the ground (d). The equation is:

c^2 = h^2 + d^2

Substituting the given values:

15^2 = 10^2 + d^2
225 = 100 + d^2
d^2 = 225 - 100
d^2 = 125
d = sqrt(125)
d = 11.18 meters

The binomial 'innovative idea + technology' is not the unequivocal key to success, why? The key issue is the 'business model', which can be translated as the element that connects what technology provides and what the market wants. A new technology that does not have a specific business model must know how to extract value from technological innovation. Therefore, the entrepreneur needs to structure his business model well, understanding how various resources interact, often in a complex way, and how the company can create and capture value from this interaction. In the tourism segment, for example, many people do not have the expertise or time to consult hotels on the internet or to enter a flight search site. For them, it is better to go to an agency. Innovative business models that have emerged in this segment have modified the market structure, and past travel agencies whose business core was the average customer have fallen by the wayside. With this, new business models focused on specific niches (for example, popular tourism) or customized products (for example, Safari in Namibia) have emerged.

}","To answer this question, we need to calculate the acceptance rate of asylum applications in Brazil. This can be done by dividing the number of refugees recognized by the country (60,011) by the total number of applications (297,712) and multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.

The calculation is as follows: (60,011 / 297,712) * 100 = 20.15%
