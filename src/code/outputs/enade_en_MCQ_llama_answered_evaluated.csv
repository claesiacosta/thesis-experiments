The binomial 'innovative idea + technology' is not the unequivocal key to success, why? The key issue is the 'business model', which can be translated as the element that connects what technology provides and what the market wants. A new technology that does not have a specific business model must know how to extract value from technological innovation. Therefore, the entrepreneur needs to structure his business model well, understanding how various resources interact, often in a complex way, and how the company can create and capture value from this interaction. In the tourism segment, for example, many people do not have the expertise or time to consult hotels on the internet or to enter a flight search site. For them, it is better to go to an agency. Innovative business models that have emerged in this segment have modified the market structure, and past travel agencies whose business core was the average customer have fallen by the wayside. With this, new business models focused on specific niches (for example, popular tourism) or customized products (for example, Safari in Namibia) have emerged.

48,34,Administration,2022,"Faced with the difficulties of evaluating staff performance during the period of social isolation due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it was recommended to adapt a widely used measure in Marketing for the area of People Management. The proposal was to use what they called 'Net Performance Promoters Score (NPPS)' or 'Net Performance Promoters Score (ELPD)', with evaluation based on three questions for each worker/employee: 1) What is the likelihood that you would recommend this organization as a workplace to friends or relatives?, with responses restricted to a 10-point scale, with extremes of 1 (indicating very unlikely) and 10 (indicating very likely); 2) Why did you indicate this score?, with an open-ended response; 3) What could be done for you to increase your score by 1 point?, with an open-ended response. Regarding the first question, respondents who indicated from 1 to 6 would be categorized as 'detractors', those who indicated 9 or 10 would be categorized as 'promoters', and the others would be categorized as 'passives'. The ELPD is defined as the difference between the percentage of promoters and the percentage of detractors.

Representative democracy requires, for its functioning, a set of characteristics, which can be understood as institutions. They are: Elected officials; Free, fair and frequent elections; Inclusive suffrage; Right to run for elective office; Freedom of expression; Diversified sources of information; Autonomy for associations. Among the mentioned categories, two stand out as pillars of the democratic regime.
Freedom of expression: citizens have the right to express themselves, without the danger of severe punishments, regarding political matters in general, which includes the freedom to criticize government officials, the government itself, the regime, the socioeconomic order, and the dominant ideology.
Diversified sources of information: citizens have the right to seek alternative, diversified, and independent sources of information. Furthermore, the existence of alternative sources of information must be protected by law.

On June 20, 2022, the news website The Intercept Brazil, in partnership with the portal Catarinas, published a story denouncing that an 11-year-old girl, pregnant after being a victim of rape, had been kept by the Justice of Santa Catarina in a shelter for over a month, in order to prevent her from having a legal abortion. According to the story, published using text and video, the girl was taken to the hospital by her mother to undergo the procedure two days after the pregnancy was discovered. Although the Penal Code allows abortion in cases of sexual violence, the medical team refused to perform the procedure. The girl was then sent to the shelter by the court, under the justification that there was a risk that the mother would take some action to end the baby's life. The report shows video excerpts of the victim's mother's testimony (image below) and the girl herself. The case had wide media coverage and the same excerpts of the testimonies were reproduced on several newscasts.
Image description: Photograph taken from a video recorded on May 9, 2022, containing the testimony of the child's mother, shows the blurred image of the deponent next to a crucifix fixed on the wall.

On June 20, 2022, the news website The Intercept Brazil, in partnership with the portal Catarinas, published a story denouncing that an 11-year-old girl, pregnant after being a victim of rape, had been kept by the Justice of Santa Catarina in a shelter for over a month, in order to prevent her from having a legal abortion. According to the story, published using text and video, the girl was taken to the hospital by her mother to undergo the procedure two days after the pregnancy was discovered. Although the Penal Code allows abortion in cases of sexual violence, the medical team refused to perform the procedure. The girl was then sent to the shelter by the court, under the justification that there was a risk that the mother would take some action to end the baby's life. The report shows video excerpts of the victim's mother's testimony (image below) and the girl herself. The case had wide media coverage and the same excerpts of the testimonies were reproduced on several newscasts.
Image description: Photograph taken from a video recorded on May 9, 2022, containing the testimony of the child's mother, shows the blurred image of the deponent next to a crucifix fixed on the wall. Below the photo, on black bars, is the following sentence: 'Mother: It's the last thing I ask for.'.

Since the modern period, photographs have been the subject of discussion about the exposure of suffering. This reflection has been developed around images that present various situations of catastrophes, wars, attacks, diseases, and accidents. If, on one hand, photographic images in mass media emerge as records of daily misfortunes and woes, on the other hand, the ethical implications of photojournalistic practice have shed light on the creation of a large gallery of sufferers transformed into examples of various themes that make up ordinary sufferings. This has been the target of criticism focused on both the exploitation of others' misfortunes and the critical and affective numbness of viewers stimulated by this torrent of images of suffering. However, photojournalism still plays an important role in the ways of perceiving the realities of the world, configuring itself as a complex field of visibility in which various pacts of access and distribution of places between bodies and speeches operate.

59,18,Journalism,2022,"TEXT 1
Since the modern period, photographs have been the subject of discussion about the exposure of suffering. This reflection has been developed around images that present various situations of catastrophes, wars, attacks, diseases, and accidents. If, on one hand, photographic images in mass media emerge as records of daily misfortunes and woes, on the other hand, the ethical implications of photojournalistic practice have shed light on the creation of a large gallery of sufferers transformed into examples of various themes that make up ordinary sufferings. This has been the target of criticism focused on both the exploitation of others' misfortunes and the critical and affective numbness of viewers stimulated by this torrent of images of suffering. However, photojournalism still plays an important role in the ways of perceiving the realities of the world, configuring itself as a complex field of visibility in which various pacts of access and distribution of places between bodies and speeches operate.

Representative democracy requires, for its functioning, a set of characteristics, which can be understood as institutions. They are: Elected officials; Free, fair and frequent elections; Inclusive suffrage; Right to run for elective office; Freedom of expression; Diversified sources of information; Autonomy for associations. Among the mentioned categories, two stand out as pillars of the democratic regime.
Freedom of expression: citizens have the right to express themselves, without the danger of severe punishments, regarding political matters in general, which includes the freedom to criticize government officials, the government itself, the regime, the socioeconomic order, and the dominant ideology.
Diversified sources of information: citizens have the right to seek alternative, diversified, and independent sources of information. Furthermore, the existence of alternative sources of information must be protected by law.

Aiming to understand the impact of a culture of sustainability on the behavior and performance of companies, a department at Harvard University in the United States published the result of a scientific investigation after analyzing the economic life of 180 companies over a period of 18 years (from 1994 to 2012). It was found that sustainable companies generated much more profit than those that did not observe sustainability.

Representative democracy requires, for its functioning, a set of characteristics, which can be understood as institutions. They are: Elected officials; Free, fair and frequent elections; Inclusive suffrage; Right to run for elective office; Freedom of expression; Diversified sources of information; Autonomy for associations. Among the mentioned categories, two stand out as pillars of the democratic regime.
Freedom of expression: citizens have the right to express themselves, without the danger of severe punishments, regarding political matters in general, which includes the freedom to criticize government officials, the government itself, the regime, the socioeconomic order, and the dominant ideology.
Diversified sources of information: citizens have the right to seek alternative, diversified, and independent sources of information. Furthermore, the existence of alternative sources of information must be protected by law.
