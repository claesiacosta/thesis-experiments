Representative democracy requires, for its functioning, a set of characteristics, which can be understood as institutions. They are: Elected officials; Free, fair and frequent elections; Inclusive suffrage; Right to run for elective office; Freedom of expression; Diversified sources of information; Autonomy for associations. Among the mentioned categories, two stand out as pillars of the democratic regime.
Freedom of expression: citizens have the right to express themselves, without the danger of severe punishments, regarding political matters in general, which includes the freedom to criticize government officials, the government itself, the regime, the socioeconomic order, and the dominant ideology.
Diversified sources of information: citizens have the right to seek alternative, diversified, and independent sources of information. Furthermore, the existence of alternative sources of information must be protected by law.

Although political regimes can be overthrown and ideologies criticized and stripped of their legitimacy, behind a regime and its ideology there is always a way of thinking and feeling, a series of cultural habits, a nebula of obscure instincts and unfathomable impulses.

Photo of Charles Humpres showing graffiti by Eduardo Kobra. The art occupies the side space of two floors of a building, characterized by the intense use of contrasts and colors that portrays a man sitting on the ground, head down, barefoot, with two empty plates by his side and holding a sign that reads 'Welcome to real Brazil'.
Initially, the transgressive nature of graffiti was seen by the State as vandalism in public space and as a danger to the conservation of private property, therefore, it should be combated.

24,15,Law,2022,"The basic principles of Criminal Law express the minimum platform on which a penal system committed to the Democratic Rule of Law can be erected.
Among these structuring norms, the principle of minimum intervention stands out, born from the Enlightenment ideals, which recognizes that punishment is an 'imperfect solution' for the protection of relevant legal goods, because it itself violates a category of this good - freedom - preventing the primary action of punitive power in defense of these interests. Therefore, the manifestation of punitive power is only legitimate when other forms of social control prove incapable of safeguarding serious disturbances to the legal order.

In May 2022, Genivaldo de Jesus Santos was suffocated and killed by tear gas, according to the Forensic Medical Institute report, inside a Federal Highway Police vehicle in the state of Sergipe, after being approached for riding a motorcycle without a helmet. During the police approach, a nephew of the victim informed that he suffered from schizophrenia, had been in treatment for about 20 years, and was taking medication, which, in fact, was in his possession. Even though the police were informed, the approach continued with the use of force and violence, disproportionate to the risk posed by Genivaldo.

TEXT 2
At the beginning of the 20th century, the first eugenic initiatives emerged in the country, whose collective problems were understood from the unwanted proliferation of people who reproduced, over consecutive generations, spreading vicious, criminal, and degenerate behavioral and mental characteristics. Under the altruistic discourse of guaranteeing treatment, the insane-criminal came to be contained and isolated in judicial asylums, institutions linked to the prison system and administered, at the time, by important psychiatrists.
