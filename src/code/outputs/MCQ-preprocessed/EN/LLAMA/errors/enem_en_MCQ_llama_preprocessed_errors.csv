The acetylsalicylic acid, AAS (molar mass equal to 180 g/mol), is synthesized from the reaction of salicylic acid 
(molar mass equal to 138 g/mol) with acetic anhydride, using sulfuric acid as a catalyst, according to the 
chemical equation:

After synthesis, AAS is purified and the final yield is approximately 50%. Due to its pharmacological properties (antipyretic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antithrombotic), AAS is used as a medication in 
the form of tablets, typically employing a mass of 500 mg of this substance.

For the merchant, the pulps are sold in 
packagings of equal volume. Currently, the packaging 
of strawberry pulp costs R$ 18.00 and acerola, 
R$ 14.70. However, there is a forecasted increase in the price 
of the acerola pulp packaging next month, 
increasing to R$ 15.30.

In order not to increase the price of the juice, the merchant 
negotiated with the supplier a reduction in the price of 
the strawberry pulp packaging.

For a season of Formula 1 races, the fuel tank capacity of each car became 100 kg of gasoline. A team chose to use gasoline with a density of 750 grams per liter, starting the race with a full tank. At the first refueling stop, a car from this team showed a record on its onboard computer indicating the consumption of four tenths of the gasoline originally in the tank. To minimize the weight of this car and ensure the end of the race, the support team refueled the car with one third of what was left in the tank upon arrival at the refueling station.

The Tupi language in Brazil

300 years ago, living in the village of São Paulo de Piratininga (dried fish, in Tupi) was almost synonymous with speaking the Indian language. Out of every five inhabitants of the city, only two knew Portuguese. Therefore, in 1698, the governor of the province, Artur de Sá e Meneses, begged Portugal to only send priests who knew 'the general language of the Indians', because 'those people do not explain themselves in any other language'.

Derived from the dialect of São Vicente, the Tupi of São Paulo developed and spread in the 17th century, thanks to the geographical isolation of the city and the unchristian activity of the Paulista mamelucos: the bandeiras, expeditions to the backlands in search of Indian slaves. Many bandeirantes did not even speak Portuguese or expressed themselves poorly. Domingos Jorge Velho, the Paulista who destroyed the Quilombo dos Palmares in 1694, was described by the bishop of Pernambuco as 'a barbarian who doesn't even know how to speak'. In their wanderings, these people baptized places like Avanhandava (place where the Indian runs), Pindamonhangaba (place to make a fishing hook), and Itu (waterfall). And ended up inventing a new language.
'The slaves of the bandeirantes came from more than 100 different tribes,' says historian and anthropologist John Monteiro, from the State University of Campinas. 'This changed the Paulista Tupi, which, in addition to the influence of Portuguese, also received words from other languages.' The result of the mixture became known as the general language of the south, a kind of simplified Tupi.

Publisher Planeta, 296 pages.

But it was a night, that Saturday night of October 21, 1967, that stopped our country. Stopped to watch the final of the III Record Festival, when a 24-year-old young man named Eduardo Lobo, Edu Lobo, left the Paramount Theater in São Paulo after winning the festival's top prize with Ponteio, which he sang accompanied by the charming and beginner Marília Medalha.

It was that night that Chico Buarque sang his Roda viva alongside MPB-4 of Magro, the arranger. That Caetano Veloso shone singing Alegria, alegria with the audience to the sound of the Beat Boys' guitars, that Gilberto Gil presented the tropicalist Domingo no parque with the Mutantes.

That night that ended up becoming a movie, in 2010, in the hands of Renato Terra and Ricardo Calil, has now become a book. The book being launched now is the story of that night, expanded and in a state that in journalistic jargon we call raw material. Those who saw the movie will delight in the stories - and some gossip - that each one has to tell, now without the necessary cuts that a movie demands. And those who did not see the movie have before them a book of stories, thinking well, of History.

Despite many children and teenagers having Barbie as an example of beauty, an infographic made by the website Rehabs.com proved that, if a woman had the measurements of the plastic doll, she wouldn't even be alive.

It's not exactly news that the proportions of the world's most famous doll are absurd for the real world. Activists fighting for a healthier self-image, researchers of eating disorders, and people concerned about the impact of cultural industry on the human psyche have been pointing out, for years, the influence of models like Barbie on the distortion of the female body.","{

Declaration of love

This is a confession of love: I love the Portuguese language. 
It is not easy. It is not malleable. [...] The Portuguese language is 
a real challenge for those who write. Especially for 
those who write, taking off the first layer of superficiality from things and people. 

Sometimes it reacts to a more complicated thought. Sometimes it is scared by the unpredictable 
of a sentence. I like to handle it - as I liked to be mounted on a horse and guide it by the reins, sometimes 
at a gallop. I wanted the Portuguese language to reach 
its maximum in my hands. And this desire is shared by all who write. A Camões and others alike were not enough 
to give us forever an inheritance of a language already made. 
All of us who write are making something that gives life to the grave of thought.

We have these difficulties. But I did not speak 
of the enchantment of dealing with a language that was not 
profound. What I inherited is not enough for me. 

If I were mute and also could not write, and 
they asked me which language I wanted to belong to, I would say: 
English, which is precise and beautiful. But, as I was not born mute and 
could write, it became absolutely clear to me 
that what I really wanted was to write in Portuguese. I even 
wished I had not learned other languages: just so that my 
approach to Portuguese would be virgin and clear.

On that morning of clear sky and light air, due to the torrential rain of the previous night, I went out for a walk with the sun still hidden to take notice of the first movements of life in the countryside. It didn't take long and the intense smell of coffee brewed by Dona Linda invaded my nostrils and made hunger awaken from that lethargic state derived from the long night of sleep. I put my hands in the water that ran through the bamboo spout and the cold contact gave me goosebumps. But I went on and cupped my hands to my face. With the impact, I stepped back and momentarily lost my breath, but the awakening was immediate. Already awake, I entered the kitchen in search of quenching my hunger and getting close to the warmth of the wood stove. That's when I noticed the slender and discreet figure of a lady accompanied by a boy who seemed to be about five years old already seated at the end of the table in an intimate chat with the lady of the house. After a vigorous 'Good morning!', a warm handshake in the customary introductions, I learned that Dona Flor de Maio was taking her son Adão for treatment of the wounds that were popping up on his body, causing small pustules with reddish edges.","{

 Zé Araújo began to sing in a sad tone, telling 
to the curious who began to arrive that a woman 
had knelt at the feet of the holy cross and sworn in 
the name of Jesus a great love, but swore and did not fulfill, 
pretended and deceived me, you lied to me, you sinned against God, the heart has reasons that reason itself 
does not know, makes promises and vows, then forgets.

  The caboclo was sad and inspired. After this 
song that gave Neusa goosebumps, he followed with 
a waltz even more spirited, full of difficult words, 
but beautiful as only the serene drop. It was the story of a 
charming doll seen in a crystal showcase on the 
majestic pedestal. Zé Araújo closed his eyes and let 
out his voice:

Her hair had the color/ Of the sun radiating/ 
Fulvous rays of love./ Her eyes were circunvagos/
Of the blue romanticism of lakes/ Lyrical hands, some 
divine arms,/ A white body like no other/ And the feet 
very small./ Finally I saw in this doll/ A perfect 
Venus.

Mr. Eduardo Gomes and Eurico Dutra, and a third, 
Mr. Getúlio Vargas, who must be a candidate of some 
hidden political group, but is also the popular candidate. 
Because there are two “we want”: the “we want” of those 
who want to see if they continue in their positions and the popular “we want”... After all, what is Mr. Getúlio Vargas? 
Is he a fascist? Is he a communist? Is he an atheist? Is he a Christian? Does he want to leave? 
Does he want to stay? However, the people seem to like him

We seek to demonstrate that development can be seen as a process of expanding real freedoms that people enjoy. The focus on human freedoms contrasts with more restrictive views of development, such as those that identify development with growth of the Gross National Product, or industrialization. The growth of the GNP can be very important as a means of expanding freedoms. But freedoms also depend on other determinants, such as education and health services and civil rights.

Much is said nowadays about human rights. 
Well, it was in the 18th century - in 1789, precisely - 
that a Constituent Assembly produced and proclaimed 
in Paris the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of 
the Citizen. This Declaration was imposed as necessary 
for a group of revolutionaries, as it was prepared 
for a change in the realm of ideas and mentalities: 
the Enlightenment.

The pessimist
Gabriel García Márquez
Gerineldo sleeps because he is already resigned to his world. Because he already knows everything that can happen to him after subjecting all the objects around him to a meticulous inventory of possibilities. His apartment, more than an apartment, is a theory of luck and misfortune. Better than anyone, Gerineldo knows the coefficient of expansion of his windows and keeps marked on the thermometer, with a red line, the point at which the glass will break, shattered into shards of death. He knows that architects and engineers have already predicted everything, except what has never happened before.

Being and Nothingness: An Essay on Phenomenological Ontology
Jean-Paul Sartre
The situation is the whole subject (he is nothing but his situation) and is also the whole thing (there is never anything but things). It is the subject elucidating things by its own overcoming, if we wish; or it is things sending back to the subject his image. It is total facticity, the absolute contingency of the world, of my birth, of my place, of my past, of my surroundings - and it is my limitless freedom that makes facticity exist for me. []","{

Originating from Romania, Genny Gleizer arrived in Brazil in 1932. Like thousands of Jews from Eastern Europe, her coming to Brazil occurred at a time of rising anti-Semitism in Europe that made their lives precarious. Brazil presented itself as a possibility in the search for survival and development.
## TEXT 2
The Jewish presence in Brazil gradually created certain suspicions that were reflected in the press and in intellectual and political circles. In part, this negative image would stem from the nationalist wave that emerged in the late 1910s, which saw immigrants as competitors to Brazilian workers, or as unproductive beings, exploiters of labor and native wealth. In addition, the political elites of the time believed that foreigners carried anarchist and communist doctrines, alien to the “Brazilian people's character”.

Michel Foucault
The economy of illegalities has been restructured with the development of capitalist society. The illegality of goods has been separated from the illegality of rights. A division that corresponds to a class opposition, because, on one hand, the illegality more accessible to the popular classes will be that of goods - violent transfer of properties; on the other hand, to the bourgeoisie, then, will be reserved the illegality of rights: the possibility of diverting their own regulations and their own laws; and this great redistribution of illegalities will even be translated by a specialization of judicial circuits; for the illegalities of goods - for theft - ordinary courts and punishments; for the illegalities of rights - fraud, tax evasion, irregular commercial operations - special jurisdictions with transactions, accommodations, mitigated fines etc. []","{

His courtiers were not a little ridiculed for this 'affected' way of eating and, at first, were not very skilled in the use of the utensil: at least it was said that half of the food fell from the fork on the way from the plate to the mouth.

Exposure to radiation from cosmic rays increases with altitude, which can pose a problem for aircraft crews. Recently, accurate measurements of ionizing radiation doses were taken for flights between Rio de Janeiro and Rome. The results have indicated that the average dose of radiation received during the cruise phase (which usually represents 80 percent of the total flight time) of this intercontinental route is 2 microsieverts per hour. International civil aviation standards limit the working time for crews operating on intercontinental flights to 1,000 hours per year. Consider that the dose of ionizing radiation for a chest X-ray is estimated at 0.2 millisieverts. []","{
