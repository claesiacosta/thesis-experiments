The binomial 'innovative idea + technology' is not the unequivocal key to success, why? The key issue is the 'business model', which can be translated as the element that connects what technology provides and what the market wants. A new technology that does not have a specific business model must know how to extract value from technological innovation. Therefore, the entrepreneur needs to structure his business model well, understanding how various resources interact, often in a complex way, and how the company can create and capture value from this interaction. In the tourism segment, for example, many people do not have the expertise or time to consult hotels on the internet or to enter a flight search site. For them, it is better to go to an agency.

Representative democracy requires, for its functioning, a set of characteristics, which can be understood as institutions. They are: Elected officials; Free, fair and frequent elections; Inclusive suffrage; Right to run for elective office; Freedom of expression; Diversified sources of information; Autonomy for associations. Among the mentioned categories, two stand out as pillars of the democratic regime.
Freedom of expression: citizens have the right to express themselves, without the danger of severe punishments, regarding political matters in general, which includes the freedom to criticize government officials, the government itself, the regime, the socioeconomic order, and the dominant ideology.
Diversified sources of information: citizens have the right to seek alternative, diversified, and independent sources of information. Furthermore, the existence of alternative sources of information must be protected by law.

On June 20, 2022, the news website The Intercept Brazil, in partnership with the portal Catarinas, published a story denouncing that an 11-year-old girl, pregnant after being a victim of rape, had been kept by the Justice of Santa Catarina in a shelter for over a month, in order to prevent her from having a legal abortion. According to the story, published using text and video, the girl was taken to the hospital by her mother to undergo the procedure two days after the pregnancy was discovered. Although the Penal Code allows abortion in cases of sexual violence, the medical team refused to perform the procedure. The girl was then sent to the shelter by the court, under the justification that there was a risk that the mother would take some action to end the baby's life. The report shows video excerpts of the victim's mother's testimony (image below) and the girl herself. The case had wide media coverage and the same excerpts of the testimonies were reproduced on several newscasts.

Since the modern period, photographs have been the subject of discussion about the exposure of suffering. This reflection has been developed around images that present various situations of catastrophes, wars, attacks, diseases, and accidents. If, on one hand, photographic images in mass media emerge as records of daily misfortunes and woes, on the other hand, the ethical implications of photojournalistic practice have shed light on the creation of a large gallery of sufferers transformed into examples of various themes that make up ordinary sufferings. This has been the target of criticism focused on both the exploitation of others' misfortunes and the critical and affective numbness of viewers stimulated by this torrent of images of suffering. However, photojournalism still plays an important role in the ways of perceiving the realities of the world, configuring itself as a complex field of visibility in which various pacts of access and distribution of places between bodies and speeches operate.

Representative democracy requires, for its functioning, a set of characteristics, which can be understood as institutions. They are: Elected officials; Free, fair and frequent elections; Inclusive suffrage; Right to run for elective office; Freedom of expression; Diversified sources of information; Autonomy for associations. Among the mentioned categories, two stand out as pillars of the democratic regime.
Freedom of expression: citizens have the right to express themselves, without the danger of severe punishments, regarding political matters in general, which includes the freedom to criticize government officials, the government itself, the regime, the socioeconomic order, and the dominant ideology.
Diversified sources of information: citizens have the right to seek alternative, diversified, and independent sources of information. Furthermore, the existence of alternative sources of information must be protected by law.

Photo of Charles Humpres showing Eduardo Kobra's graffiti. The art occupies the side space of two floors of a building, characterized by the intense use of contrasts and colors depicting a man sitting on the ground, head down, barefoot, with two empty plates beside him and holding a sign that reads 'Welcome to real Brazil'.
Initially, the transgressive nature of graffiti was seen by the State as vandalism in public space and as a danger to the conservation of private property, therefore, it should be combated. Over time, however, this marginal conception has transformed, leading to an acceptable valorization by the State and positive for society.

Constitutional supremacy translates into formal and material superlegality. Formal superlegality identifies the Constitution as the primary source of normative production, dictating competences and procedures for the elaboration of lower normative acts. And material superlegality subordinates the content of all state normative activity to conformity with the principles and rules of the Constitution. The non-compliance with these formal and material prescriptions triggers a mechanism for protecting the Constitution, known among us as constitutional review.

The integrity of the environment cannot be compromised by individual interests, just as strict liability, in the environmental field, guided by the principles of polluter-pays and full reparation, cannot be eluded by the application of the de minimis principle. The jurisprudence of the Superior Court of Justice and the Federal Supreme Court is firm in not allowing the prevalence of defense theses in environmental law that, through oblique means, seek to protect alleged acquired rights to deforestation, nor admit the invocation of the theory of fait accompli as a way to exempt the offender from the duty to promote the recovery of the area affected by human intervention. Otherwise, it would be endorsing that the fundamental, non-negotiable, and intergenerational right to a balanced environment, constitutionally enshrined in Article 225 of the Federal Constitution, could be subjugated to selfish claims.

Representative democracy requires, for its functioning, a set of characteristics, which can be understood as institutions. They are: Elected officials; Free, fair and frequent elections; Inclusive suffrage; Right to run for elective office; Freedom of expression; Diversified sources of information; Autonomy for associations. Among the mentioned categories, two stand out as pillars of the democratic regime.
Freedom of expression: citizens have the right to express themselves, without the danger of severe punishments, regarding political matters in general, which includes the freedom to criticize government officials, the government itself, the regime, the socioeconomic order, and the dominant ideology.
Diversified sources of information: citizens have the right to seek alternative, diversified, and independent sources of information. Furthermore, the existence of alternative sources of information must be protected by law.

The murder of the indigenist Bruno Pereira and the journalist Dom Phillips exposed to the world the importance of demarcating indigenous territories, guaranteed by the 1988 Federal Constitution. Indigenous territories, besides preserving identities, ways of life, traditions, and cultures of these peoples, are also essential for environmental preservation. They contribute to containing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting biodiversity, and enhancing systems.
If the Temporal Framework criterion is maintained, the land war could be intensified. The territories will become areas of more conflicts between farmers, miners, prospectors, land grabbers, rural producers, drug traffickers, fish traders, hunters, and loggers, resulting in the death of indigenous people and forest defenders, and, by extension, of indigenous territories.",What could happen if the Temporal Framework criterion is maintained?,Apply,Advanced,"[{'A': 'It will lead to the demarcation of more indigenous territories', 'B': 'It will intensify the land war between farmers and indigenous people', 'C': 'It will promote biodiversity and enhance systems', 'D': 'It will contain greenhouse gas emissions', 'E': 'It will not have any impact on indigenous territories'}]",['B'],B,It will intensify the land war between farmers and indigenous people,"{'question': 'What could happen if the Temporal Framework criterion is maintained?', 'bloom_level': 'Apply', 'difficult_level': 'Advanced', 'options': [{'A': 'It will lead to the demarcation of more indigenous territories', 'B': 'It will intensify the land war between farmers and indigenous people', 'C': 'It will promote biodiversity and enhance systems', 'D': 'It will contain greenhouse gas emissions', 'E': 'It will not have any impact on indigenous territories'}], 'correct_answer': ['B'], 'correct_answer_letter': 'B', 'correct_answer_text': 'It will intensify the land war between farmers and indigenous people'}",,,,,,,,,
