Researchers were able to stimulate the absorption of 
light energy in plants thanks to the use of carbon 
nanotubes. For this, carbon nanotubes 'inserted' into the interior of chloroplasts through a spontaneous assembly, through the membranes of the chloroplasts. Plant pigments absorb light radiation, electrons are 'excited' and move within the chloroplast membranes, and the plant then uses this electrical energy to produce sugars. Carbon nanotubes can absorb wavelengths usually not used by chloroplasts, and researchers had the idea of using them as 'antennas', stimulating the conversion of solar energy by chloroplasts, with increased electron transport.

Plant pigments absorb light radiation, electrons are 'excited' and move within the chloroplast membranes, and the plant then uses this electrical energy to produce sugars. Carbon nanotubes can absorb wavelengths usually not used by chloroplasts, and researchers had the idea of using them as 'antennas', stimulating the conversion of solar energy by chloroplasts, with increased electron transport.

Carbon nanotubes enhance plant photosynthesis.

of a mixture between two immiscible phases. The sample components are separated between the stationary phase and 
the mobile phase moving on the paper. The stationary phase consists of practically pure cellulose, which can absorb 
up to 22% of water. It is the absorbed water that functions as a liquid stationary phase and interacts with the mobile phase, 
also liquid (liquid-liquid partition). Components capable of forming stronger intermolecular interactions

The project includes 100 m² of solar panels that will be 
installed in the parking areas, producing electrical energy 
and providing shade for the cars. About the pediatric hospital 
approximately 300 m² of panels will be installed, with 100 m² for generating electrical energy used on the 
campus, and 200 m² for thermal energy generation, producing 
water heating used in the hospital boilers.

Suppose that each square meter of solar panel 
for electrical energy generates a saving of 1 kWh per day 
and each square meter producing thermal energy allows 
saving 0.7 kWh per day for the university. In 
a second phase of the project, the area 
covered by the solar panels generating 
electrical energy will be increased by 75%. In this phase, the area 
of coverage with panels for thermal energy generation should also be expanded.

numbers are in ascending order, from top to bottom, 
from -30 ºC to 50 ºC. In the right column, the numbers 
are ordered in ascending order, from bottom to top,

The reveler

When Admiral Cabral
Set foot in Brazil
The guardian angel of the Indians
Was strolling in Paris.
When he returned from his trip
The Dutchman was already here.
The angel breathes happily:
""It's okay, these are good people,
I'll air out again.""
The angel crossed the bar,
Says goodbye to Pernambuco,
Makes noise, hubbub,
Just like the zeppelin
But a wind hit the angel,
He lost his memory...
And never came back.

Weekend at the park

Look at my people in the favelas and you will realize
From here I see a brand new car
Fully equipped and the old man driving
With his children by his side they are going to the park
Euphoric electronic toys
Automatically I imagine
The kids from the area how they are
Probably running around here and there
Playing barefoot soccer in the dirt streets
Yeah, they play the way they can
[...]
Look at that club, how cool
Look at that court, look at that field, look
Look how many people
There's an ice cream shop, cinema, hot pool

In the summer of 1954, the artist Robert Rauschenberg 
(b.1925) coined the term combine to refer to his 
new works that had aspects of both painting and 
sculpture.

In 1958, Bed was selected to be included in an 
exhibition of young American and Italian artists 
at the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy.
However, the festival organizers refused to 
show the work and removed it to a storage.

While the art world debated the innovation of 
hanging a bed on a wall, Rauschenberg 
considered his work 'one of the most welcoming 
paintings I've ever painted, but I've always been 
afraid someone would want to crawl into it'.

João/Zero (Wagner Moura) is a brilliant scientist, but 
unhappy because 20 years ago he was publicly humiliated 
during a party and lost Helena (Alinne Moraes), an 
old and eternal passion. One day, an experiment with 
one of his inventions allows him to travel in 
time, returning to that time and being able to interfere 
in his destiny. But when he returns, he finds out that 
his life has completely changed and now he needs to find a way to change that story, even if he has to 
return to the past again. Will he be able to 
get things right?

This is about the progressive loss of productivity of entire biomes, affecting very expressive portions of the sub-humid and semi-arid domains in all hot regions of the world.

The concept of democracy, in Habermas' thought, is built from a procedural dimension based on discourse and deliberation. Democratic legitimacy requires that the process of political decision-making occurs from a broad public discussion, only then deciding.

The concept of democracy, in Habermas' thought, is built from a procedural dimension based on discourse and deliberation. Democratic legitimacy requires that the process of political decision-making occurs from a broad public discussion, only then deciding.

He knows very well that he will not be able to pay, but also sees that they will not lend him anything if he does not promise firmly to pay within a specified period. Feels tempted to make the promise; but still has enough conscience to ask himself: is it not forbidden and contrary to duty to get out of trouble in this way?

A small Brazilian publisher, Urutau, has just launched in Lisbon an “anti-racist anthology of foreign poets in Portugal”, entitled Go back to your land.
The book denounces the various forms of racism to which immigrants are subjected. Some of the Brazilian poets anthologized complain about the disdain with which a large number of Portuguese people welcome Brazilian Portuguese. It is a common complaint.
“Here in Portugal they say / - they say - / that our Portuguese is wrong, that we do not speak Portuguese”, writes the São Paulo poet Maria Giulia Pinheiro, to conclude: “If your language, the Lusitanian one, / still retains the word of oppression / it is not the most beautiful in the world./ It is one of the most violent.” []",What is the title of the anthology launched by the Brazilian publisher Urutau in Lisbon?,Remember,Beginner,"[{'A': 'Go back to your country', 'B': 'Go back to your land', 'C': 'Portuguese language book', 'D': 'Language without borders', 'E': 'Racism anthology'}]",['B'],B,Go back to your land,"{'question': 'What is the title of the anthology launched by the Brazilian publisher Urutau in Lisbon?', 'bloom_level': 'Remember', 'difficult_level': 'Beginner', 'options': [{'A': 'Go back to your country', 'B': 'Go back to your land', 'C': 'Portuguese language book', 'D': 'Language without borders', 'E': 'Racism anthology'}], 'correct_answer': ['B'], 'correct_answer_letter': 'B', 'correct_answer_text': 'Go back to your land'}",,,,,,,,,

He moved slowly, swaying all his fringes and vigorously fanning himself with one of those sandalwood wooden fans, which enveloped him in a nauseating wave of perfume. I don't know exactly what he had put on his head, it looked more like a turban or a hat without brims from which vigorous strands of blond hair emerged. As was also his custom, he wore makeup on his face — and for this, as well as for his clothing, he had taken over all the wardrobe left by his mother, also in her time famous for the extravagance with which she dressed — which undoubtedly made his huge nose stand out, so characteristic of the Meneses family.

This is done based on the relationship between the remaining carbon-14 in the fossil and the amount of carbon-14 in a similar current species. Despite undergoing radioactive decay, the amount of carbon-14 in the atmosphere, particularly in CO2 molecules, is practically constant, due to the incidence of cosmic rays that reach the Earth at all times. Thus, as part of the carbon cycle, animals and plants maintain a practically constant amount of carbon-14 in their constitution while they are alive. However, when they die, the entry of carbon into the organism ceases and this number decreases as carbon-14 decays radioactively.

Amazonian soils, rich in silicate, are not suitable for cultivation because they are unable to retain nutrients. However, archaeological discoveries have shown that the ancient inhabitants of the Amazon mastered the technique of preparing a natural agricultural input, called black earth. This input consisted mainly of a type of biochar obtained from the burning of organic matter, such as tree trunks, pieces of bones, and manure, capable of keeping the soil fertile for years.
It is admitted that the effect of biochar on soil fertilization was, in part, related to the presence of carboxylate organic groups on its surface, negatively charged (single COO bond with negative charge). These groups attract positive ions necessary as nutrients, such as those from potassium, calcium, and magnesium, as well as micronutrients, such as zinc and iron. This bond in the fertilized soil is predominantly ionic, as illustrated in the figure, where M of positive charge n represents the metallic cations. According to the Pauling scale, the electronegativity of the oxygen element is equal to 3.44.
