0,16,Administration,2022,"When using the market analysis model proposed by Porter, one seeks to identify the forces at play in a dynamic and competitive market, determining the intensity of competition in a given sector. Next, the figure representing the mentioned model is presented.
Figure description: Title: 'Porter's Five Competitive Forces'. Highlighted are the companies that are already competitors in the industrial field. Above these competing companies, there are two threats: potential new entrants and substitute products and services. Also acting on these competing companies are buyers and suppliers with their bargaining power. Thus, potential entrants, substitutes, suppliers, and buyers influence competing companies in the industry.","{

1,17,Administration,2022,"With inflation, the purchasing power of the citizen is reduced if the salary does not keep up with the price increases. Subsequently, this reduction in consumption, due to the impoverishment of people, affects companies, which sell less because people are buying less. This process leads to a reduction in production and a decrease in GDP (Gross Domestic Product). In summary, inflation causes money to lose value, since it does not keep up with price increases, therefore reducing purchasing power and GDP. According to the Inflation Report of the Central Bank of Brazil, from July 2022, the expectations for the variation of the National Consumer Price Index (IPCA), as surveyed by Focus, are around 7.96% for 2022, and GDP growth was adjusted to 1.51%.","{
