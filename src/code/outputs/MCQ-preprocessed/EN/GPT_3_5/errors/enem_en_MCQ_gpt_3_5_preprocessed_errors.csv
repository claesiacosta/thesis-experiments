The solar energy will supply part of the energy demand 
of the campus of a Brazilian university. The installation of 
solar panels in the parking areas and on the roof 
of the pediatric hospital will be used in the university facilities 
and also connected to the grid of the electricity distribution company.

The project includes 100 m² of solar panels that will be 
installed in the parking areas, producing electrical energy 
and providing shade for the cars. About the pediatric hospital 
approximately 300 m² of panels will be installed, with 100 m² for generating electrical energy used on the 
campus, and 200 m² for thermal energy generation, producing 
water heating used in the hospital boilers.

Suppose that each square meter of solar panel 
for electrical energy generates a saving of 1 kWh per day 
and each square meter producing thermal energy allows 
saving 0.7 kWh per day for the university. In 
a second phase of the project, the area 
covered by the solar panels generating 
electrical energy will be increased by 75%. In this phase, the area 
of coverage with panels for thermal energy generation should also be expanded.

A person finds himself forced by necessity to borrow money. He knows very well that he will not be able to pay, but also sees that they will not lend him anything if he does not promise firmly to pay within a specified period. Feels tempted to make the promise; but still has enough conscience to ask himself: is it not forbidden and contrary to duty to get out of trouble in this way? Assuming that he decides to do so, his maxim of action would be: when I think I am in financial trouble, I will borrow it and promise to pay it back, although I know that this will never happen.
