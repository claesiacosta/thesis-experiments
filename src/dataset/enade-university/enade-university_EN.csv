Representative democracy requires, for its functioning, a set of characteristics, which can be understood as institutions. They are: Elected officials; Free, fair and frequent elections; Inclusive suffrage; Right to run for elective office; Freedom of expression; Diversified sources of information; Autonomy for associations. Among the mentioned categories, two stand out as pillars of the democratic regime.
Freedom of expression: citizens have the right to express themselves, without the danger of severe punishments, regarding political matters in general, which includes the freedom to criticize government officials, the government itself, the regime, the socioeconomic order, and the dominant ideology.
Diversified sources of information: citizens have the right to seek alternative, diversified, and independent sources of information. Furthermore, the existence of alternative sources of information must be protected by law.

Although political regimes can be overthrown and ideologies criticized and stripped of their legitimacy, behind a regime and its ideology there is always a way of thinking and feeling, a series of cultural habits, a nebula of obscure instincts and unfathomable impulses.

Democracy is the system that aims to ensure its citizens a broader personal freedom than other models.
Freedom of expression in the democratic system ensures that the manifestation of a political agent and a citizen have equivalent repercussions.
Fake news are manifestations related to the category of diversified sources of information and can be used as a strategy to weaken the democratic system of government.
The right to freedom of expression allows the issuance of critical opinions and speeches contrary to democracy and human rights.

The murder of the indigenist Bruno Pereira and the journalist Dom Phillips exposed to the world the importance of demarcating indigenous territories, guaranteed by the 1988 Federal Constitution. Indigenous territories, besides preserving identities, ways of life, traditions, and cultures of these peoples, are also essential for environmental preservation. They contribute to containing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting biodiversity, and enhancing systems.
If the Temporal Framework criterion is maintained, the land conflict may intensify. The territories will become areas of more conflicts between farmers, miners, prospectors, land grabbers, rural producers, drug traffickers, fish traders, hunters, and loggers, resulting in the death of indigenous people and forest defenders, and by extension, of indigenous territories.","Based on the texts presented, evaluate the following statements, indicating which ones are correct.
Indigenous territories, with the regulation of the Temporal Framework, will be formally protected from invasions, and the original peoples will be able to maintain their cultural traditions.
The actions of groups of prospectors, illegal fishermen, deforesters, and some sectors of agricultural activities have been confronting the original peoples in territorial disputes.
The increase in crime in indigenous territories is associated with the economic interests of unsustainable exploitation of the environment, such as those related to illegal mining and deforestation.
The existence of indigenous social movements is essential for the struggle for social, cultural, and land access rights by the original peoples, as well as for the preservation of the environment and the way of life of indigenous peoples.

Initially, the transgressive nature of graffiti was seen by the State as vandalism in public space and as a danger to the conservation of private property, therefore, it should be combated. Over time, however, this marginal conception has transformed, leading to an acceptable valorization by the State and positive for society. This transition of graffiti, from marginal art to recognized and accepted artistic expression, has revealed important aspects not only for graffiti professionals, but for society as a whole, as it incorporates the possibility of being an artistic product of cultural, economic, and ideological value.

This theory emerged between the 1940s and 1950s and has been present in managerial practices and trends since then. Game theory, queuing theory, probability theory, and linear programming, applied to managerial problems, are techniques and methods recurring in mathematical sciences that originated from Mathematical Theory. The recent evolution of the use of Mathematical Theory is evidenced in the methods and processes of Big Data, Business Intelligence, and Business Analytics, which use computational platforms with large volumes of data in different formats (numeric, textual, visual). When considering the different specialties and managerial functions, there are variations in the intensity of use of these tools, in areas that make intensive use of methods and tools, and in others that have reduced use.

Step H (Inform the customer of the product shortage and delivery time) corresponds to information provided by the company to the customer, and therefore, the symbol used (n. 2) will have the same effect if changed to symbol n. 3. 
Considering that the customer has decided to wait for the product delivery (step I), the terms of step B (Receive the order) can be maintained, it is inappropriate to change them to “Receive the product”, since the flowchart process should be restarted.

The binomial 'innovative idea + technology' is not the unequivocal key to success, why? The key issue is the 'business model', which can be translated as the element that connects what technology provides and what the market wants. A new technology that does not have a specific business model must know how to extract value from technological innovation. Therefore, the entrepreneur needs to structure his business model well, understanding how various resources interact, often in a complex way, and how the company can create and capture value from this interaction. In the tourism segment, for example, many people do not have the expertise or time to consult hotels on the internet or to enter a flight search site. For them, it is better to go to an agency. Innovative business models that have emerged in this segment have modified the market structure, and past travel agencies whose business core was the average customer have fallen by the wayside. With this, new business models focused on specific niches (for example, popular tourism) or customized products (for example, Safari in Namibia) have emerged.

The proposal was to use what they called 'Net Performance Promoters Score (NPPS)' or 'Net Performance Promoters Score (ELPD)', with evaluation based on three questions for each worker/employee: 1) What is the likelihood that you would recommend this organization as a workplace to friends or relatives?, with responses restricted to a 10-point scale, with extremes of 1 (indicating very unlikely) and 10 (indicating very likely); 2) Why did you indicate this score?, with an open-ended response; 3) What could be done for you to increase your score by 1 point?, with an open-ended response. Regarding the first question, respondents who indicated from 1 to 6 would be categorized as 'detractors', those who indicated 9 or 10 would be categorized as 'promoters', and the others would be categorized as 'passives'.

Representative democracy requires, for its functioning, a set of characteristics, which can be understood as institutions. They are: Elected officials; Free, fair and frequent elections; Inclusive suffrage; Right to run for elective office; Freedom of expression; Diversified sources of information; Autonomy for associations. Among the mentioned categories, two stand out as pillars of the democratic regime.
Freedom of expression: citizens have the right to express themselves, without the danger of severe punishments, regarding political matters in general, which includes the freedom to criticize government officials, the government itself, the regime, the socioeconomic order, and the dominant ideology.
Diversified sources of information: citizens have the right to seek alternative, diversified, and independent sources of information. Furthermore, the existence of alternative sources of information must be protected by law.

The increase in crime in indigenous territories is associated with the economic interests of unsustainable exploitation of the environment, such as those related to illegal mining and deforestation.
The existence of indigenous social movements is essential for the struggle for social, cultural, and land access rights by the original peoples, as well as for the preservation of the environment and the way of life of indigenous peoples.

Photo of Charles Humpres showing graffiti by Eduardo Kobra. The art occupies the side space of two floors of a building, characterized by the intense use of contrasts and colors that portrays a man sitting on the ground, head down, barefoot, with two empty plates by his side and holding a sign that reads 'Welcome to real Brazil'.
Initially, the transgressive nature of graffiti was seen by the State as vandalism in public space and as a danger to the conservation of private property, therefore, it should be combated. Over time, however, this marginal conception has transformed, leading to an acceptable valorization by the State and positive for society. This transition of graffiti, from marginal art to recognized and accepted artistic expression, has revealed important aspects not only for graffiti professionals, but for society as a whole, as it incorporates the possibility of being an artistic product of cultural, economic, and ideological value.

On June 20, 2022, the news website The Intercept Brazil, in partnership with the portal Catarinas, published a story denouncing that an 11-year-old girl, pregnant after being a victim of rape, had been kept by the Justice of Santa Catarina in a shelter for over a month, in order to prevent her from having a legal abortion. According to the story, published using text and video, the girl was taken to the hospital by her mother to undergo the procedure two days after the pregnancy was discovered. Although the Penal Code allows abortion in cases of sexual violence, the medical team refused to perform the procedure. The girl was then sent to the shelter by the court, under the justification that there was a risk that the mother would take some action to end the baby's life. The report shows video excerpts of the victim's mother's testimony (image below) and the girl herself. The case had wide media coverage and the same excerpts of the testimonies were reproduced on several newscasts.

Since the modern period, photographs have been the subject of discussion about the exposure of suffering. This reflection has been developed around images that present various situations of catastrophes, wars, attacks, diseases, and accidents. If, on one hand, photographic images in mass media emerge as records of daily misfortunes and woes, on the other hand, the ethical implications of photojournalistic practice have shed light on the creation of a large gallery of sufferers transformed into examples of various themes that make up ordinary sufferings. This has been the target of criticism focused on both the exploitation of others' misfortunes and the critical and affective numbness of viewers stimulated by this torrent of images of suffering. However, photojournalism still plays an important role in the ways of perceiving the realities of the world, configuring itself as a complex field of visibility in which various pacts of access and distribution of places between bodies and speeches operate.

Representative democracy requires, for its functioning, a set of characteristics, which can be understood as institutions. They are: Elected officials; Free, fair and frequent elections; Inclusive suffrage; Right to run for elective office; Freedom of expression; Diversified sources of information; Autonomy for associations. Among the mentioned categories, two stand out as pillars of the democratic regime.
Freedom of expression: citizens have the right to express themselves, without the danger of severe punishments, regarding political matters in general, which includes the freedom to criticize government officials, the government itself, the regime, the socioeconomic order, and the dominant ideology.
Diversified sources of information: citizens have the right to seek alternative, diversified, and independent sources of information. Furthermore, the existence of alternative sources of information must be protected by law.

13,2022,"Between Tax Law and Economics there is a natural and necessary connection, since the State is the main responsible for economic regulation. Therefore, it is imperative for it to create mechanisms that point out to society and the market the economic model it has adopted. In this sense, Tax Law, in its extrafiscal function, seems to be the ideal tool to guide the taxpayer through the economic paths chosen by the State. It is said to be in its extrafiscal function because tax norms can also assume a fiscal and parafiscal function.
As observed, extrafiscality acts in a way to 'induce' the economic agent to behave as it seems desirable to the State. In this aspect, it has long been realized that tax law is better obeyed when, instead of determining behaviors, it uses the most subtle way to influence them, granting taxpayers subsidies, exemptions, presumed credits, bonuses, etc. With such artifice, people feel free to conduct their business and tend to do what the Nation expects of them.

To achieve this goal, tax benefits are sometimes used to mitigate the tax burden. In these cases, it can be considered, at first, that this was done to achieve higher purposes.

However, this threefold approach was not implemented in Brazil, due to the political choice adopted by the military regime, enshrined in the Amnesty Law (Law 6.683/1979), based on the ideals of forgiveness and forgetting. When judging the Direct Action of Unconstitutionality (ADPF) No. 153 in 2010, the Federal Supreme Court analyzed the constitutionality of the Amnesty Law in light of the 1988 Federal Constitution and expressed the understanding that the decision to enact the Amnesty Law stems from the state sovereignty of the country and, therefore, Brazil would not be obliged to revise it. In 2010, Brazil was condemned by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in the Gomes Lund case, which carried out the control of conventionality between the Brazilian Amnesty Law and the American Convention on Human Rights, in order to prevent the application of amnesty to crimes against humanity committed by public agents during the military regime. In 2018, Brazil was again condemned by the Inter-American Court for the deprivation of liberty, torture, and murder of journalist Vladimir Herzog within the premises of the Brazilian State body responsible for investigating citizens opposed to the regime.

Representative democracy requires, for its functioning, a set of characteristics, which can be understood as institutions. They are: Elected officials; Free, fair and frequent elections; Inclusive suffrage; Right to run for elective office; Freedom of expression; Diversified sources of information; Autonomy for associations. Among the mentioned categories, two stand out as pillars of the democratic regime.
Freedom of expression: citizens have the right to express themselves, without the danger of severe punishments, regarding political matters in general, which includes the freedom to criticize government officials, the government itself, the regime, the socioeconomic order, and the dominant ideology.
Diversified sources of information: citizens have the right to seek alternative, diversified, and independent sources of information. Furthermore, the existence of alternative sources of information must be protected by law.

They contribute to containing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting biodiversity, and enhancing systems.

The increase in crime in indigenous territories is associated with the economic interests of unsustainable exploitation of the environment, such as those related to illegal mining and deforestation.
The existence of indigenous social movements is essential for the struggle for social, cultural, and land access rights by the original peoples, as well as for the preservation of the environment and the way of life of indigenous peoples.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the first eugenic initiatives emerged in the country, whose collective problems were understood from the unwanted proliferation of people who reproduced, over consecutive generations, spreading vicious, criminal, and degenerate behavioral and mental characteristics. Under the altruistic discourse of guaranteeing treatment, the insane-criminal came to be contained and isolated in judicial asylums, institutions linked to the prison system and administered, at the time, by important psychiatrists.

Historically, the isolation, violence, and death of people in psychological distress have been justified as necessary security procedures to ensure the collective good and the defense of society. 
For eugenic thought, controlling the behavior of individuals considered degenerate should be done through psychosocial treatment of these individuals marginalized by society. 
Even after the Psychiatric Reform, the association between madness and dangerousness has been used as a strategic argument for maintaining judicial asylums. 
Genivaldo's case brings together elements that evoke the marks of eugenic thought, such as the criminalization of poor and black people. 
Although Genivaldo's death could have been avoided, at times, the disproportionate use of force is justified due to the aggressive and unpredictable behaviors of schizophrenia.
