On July 1st, 2012, the city of Rio de Janeiro 
became the first in the world to receive the title of 
UNESCO World Heritage as a Cultural Landscape. 
The application, submitted by the National Institute of 
Historical and Artistic Heritage (Iphan), was approved 
during the 36th Session of the World Heritage Committee. 
The president of Iphan explained that 'the carioca landscape 
is the most explicit image of what we can call 
Brazilian civilization, with its originality, challenges, 
contradictions, and possibilities.' From now on, the 
places in the city valued with the UNESCO title will be 
the target of integrated actions aimed at preserving its 
cultural landscape.

Some time ago I realized that, since my early years, I had received many false opinions as true, and that what I later founded on such poorly secured principles could only be very doubtful and uncertain. It was necessary to seriously try, once in my life, to get rid of all the opinions to which I had previously given credit, and start all over again in order to establish a firm and unshakable knowledge.

DESCARTES, R. Meditations on First Philosophy. São Paulo: Abril Cultural, 1973 (adapted).

TEXT II

It is the radical nature of what is sought that demands the radicalization of the search process itself. If all space is occupied by doubt, any certainty that appears from there will have been in some way generated by doubt itself, and will certainly not be any of those that were previously swept away by that same doubt.

From end to end, it's all palm beach, very flat and 
very beautiful. Through the backlands, it seemed to us, seen from the sea, 
very large, because, stretching our eyes, we could not 
see anything but land with trees, which seemed very 
long to us. So far, we could not find out if there is gold, 
nor silver, nor anything made of metal or iron; nor did we see it. But the land itself has very good airs [...]. 
But the best fruit that can be taken from it seems to me 
that it will be to save these people.

In the shields was our protection,

 were units of 
 fighters formed by volunteers from 53 nationalities 
 willing to fight in defense of the Spanish Republic. 
 It is estimated that about 60,000 citizens from various

 by the communists, the Brigades had 
 members who were socialists, liberals, and from other

Of all the transformations imposed by the technical-scientific-informational environment on transport logistics, we are most interested in intermodality. And for a very simple reason: the potential that such a 'logistic tool' boasts allows for a transportation system that is indeed commensurate with Brazil's geographical scale.

Hence arises a question: whether it is better to be loved than feared, or feared than loved. It might be answered that we should wish to be both; but since love and fear can hardly exist together, if we must choose between them, it is far safer to be feared than loved when one of the two must be lacking. For men in general are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you.","

At the end of the 19th century, the Great Carnival Societies 
reached wide popularity among the carioca revelers. Such societies cultivated a pretentious 
objective regarding the carnival celebration itself: with their parades of decorated cars through 
the main streets of the city, they intended to abolish the 'entrudo' (a game consisting of throwing water at revelers) and other practices spread among the population since colonial times, replacing them with forms of entertainment they considered more civilized, 
inspired by the carnivals of Venice. However, no one seemed willing 
to give up their amusements to attend the societies' carnival. The 'entrudo', in the view of its lively practitioners, could perfectly coexist with the parades.","
