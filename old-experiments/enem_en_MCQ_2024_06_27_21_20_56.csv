Researchers were able to stimulate the absorption of 
light energy in plants thanks to the use of carbon 
nanotubes. For this, carbon nanotubes 'inserted' into the interior of chloroplasts through a spontaneous assembly, through the membranes of the chloroplasts. Plant pigments absorb light radiation, electrons are 'excited' and move within the chloroplast membranes, and the plant then uses this electrical energy to produce sugars. Carbon nanotubes can absorb wavelengths usually not used by chloroplasts, and researchers had the idea of using them as 'antennas', stimulating the conversion of solar energy by chloroplasts, with increased electron transport.

Carbon nanotubes enhance plant photosynthesis.

Some types of desalination plants use the process of 
reverse osmosis to obtain drinking water from 
saltwater. In this method, a container is used 
containing two compartments separated by a 
semipermeable membrane: in one of them saltwater is placed 
and in the other drinking water is collected. The application 
of mechanical pressure on the system causes the water to flow from one 
compartment to the other. The movement of water molecules 
through the membrane is controlled by osmotic pressure and the applied mechanical pressure.

The paper chromatography is a separation method based on the differential migration of components 
of a mixture between two immiscible phases. The sample components are separated between the stationary phase and 
the mobile phase moving on the paper. The stationary phase consists of practically pure cellulose, which can absorb 
up to 22% of water. It is the absorbed water that functions as a liquid stationary phase and interacts with the mobile phase, 
also liquid (liquid-liquid partition). Components capable of forming stronger intermolecular interactions 
with the stationary phase migrate more slowly.

A mixture of hexane with 5% (v/v) acetone was used as the mobile phase in the separation of components 
from a plant extract obtained from peppers. Consider that this extract contains the substances represented.

A physiotherapist, aiming to maximize the beneficial effect of the exercises he would recommend to one of his patients, wanted to study this equation and classified it as follows:


The physiotherapist analyzed the dependence between v and p in the Hill equation and classified it according to its geometric representation on the Cartesian plane, using the coordinate pair (p; v).

For a season of Formula 1 races, the fuel tank capacity of each car became 100 kg of gasoline. A team chose to use gasoline with a density of 750 grams per liter, starting the race with a full tank. At the first refueling stop, a car from this team showed a record on its onboard computer indicating the consumption of four tenths of the gasoline originally in the tank. To minimize the weight of this car and ensure the end of the race, the support team refueled the car with one third of what was left in the tank upon arrival at the refueling station.

The Tupi language in Brazil

300 years ago, living in the village of S√£o Paulo de Piratininga (dried fish, in Tupi) was almost synonymous with speaking the Indian language. Out of every five inhabitants of the city, only two knew Portuguese. Therefore, in 1698, the governor of the province, Artur de S√° e Meneses, begged Portugal to only send priests who knew 'the general language of the Indians', because 'those people do not explain themselves in any other language'.

Derived from the dialect of S√£o Vicente, the Tupi of S√£o Paulo developed and spread in the 17th century, thanks to the geographical isolation of the city and the unchristian activity of the Paulista mamelucos: the bandeiras, expeditions to the backlands in search of Indian slaves. Many bandeirantes did not even speak Portuguese or expressed themselves poorly. Domingos Jorge Velho, the Paulista who destroyed the Quilombo dos Palmares in 1694, was described by the bishop of Pernambuco as 'a barbarian who doesn't even know how to speak'. In their wanderings, these people baptized places like Avanhandava (place where the Indian runs), Pindamonhangaba (place to make a fishing hook), and Itu (waterfall). And ended up inventing a new language.
'The slaves of the bandeirantes came from more than 100 different tribes,' says historian and anthropologist John Monteiro, from the State University of Campinas. 'This changed the Paulista Tupi, which, in addition to the influence of Portuguese, also received words from other languages.' The result of the mixture became known as the general language of the south, a kind of simplified Tupi.

The reveler

When Admiral Cabral
Set foot in Brazil
The guardian angel of the Indians
Was strolling in Paris.
When he returned from his trip
The Dutchman was already here.
The angel breathes happily:
""It's okay, these are good people,
I'll air out again.""
The angel crossed the bar,
Says goodbye to Pernambuco,
Makes noise, hubbub,
Just like the zeppelin
But a wind hit the angel,
He lost his memory...
And never came back.

20,"LANGUAGES, CODES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES",2017,"One night in 67, by Renato Terra and Ricardo Calil. 
Publisher Planeta, 296 pages.

But it was a night, that Saturday night of October 21, 1967, that stopped our country. Stopped to watch the final of the III Record Festival, when a 24-year-old young man named Eduardo Lobo, Edu Lobo, left the Paramount Theater in S√£o Paulo after winning the festival's top prize with Ponteio, which he sang accompanied by the charming and beginner Mar√≠lia Medalha.

It was that night that Chico Buarque sang his Roda viva alongside MPB-4 of Magro, the arranger. That Caetano Veloso shone singing Alegria, alegria with the audience to the sound of the Beat Boys' guitars, that Gilberto Gil presented the tropicalist Domingo no parque with the Mutantes.

That night that ended up becoming a movie, in 2010, in the hands of Renato Terra and Ricardo Calil, has now become a book. The book being launched now is the story of that night, expanded and in a state that in journalistic jargon we call raw material. Those who saw the movie will delight in the stories - and some gossip - that each one has to tell, now without the necessary cuts that a movie demands. And those who did not see the movie have before them a book of stories, thinking well, of History.

Declaration of love

This is a confession of love: I love the Portuguese language. 
It is not easy. It is not malleable. [...] The Portuguese language is 
a real challenge for those who write. Especially for 
those who write, taking off the first layer of superficiality from things and people. 

Sometimes it reacts to a more complicated thought. Sometimes it is scared by the unpredictable 
of a sentence. I like to handle it - as I liked to be mounted on a horse and guide it by the reins, sometimes 
at a gallop. I wanted the Portuguese language to reach 
its maximum in my hands. And this desire is shared by all who write. A Cam√µes and others alike were not enough 
to give us forever an inheritance of a language already made. 
All of us who write are making something that gives life to the grave of thought.

We have these difficulties. But I did not speak 
of the enchantment of dealing with a language that was not 
profound. What I inherited is not enough for me. 

If I were mute and also could not write, and 
they asked me which language I wanted to belong to, I would say: 
English, which is precise and beautiful. But, as I was not born mute and 
could write, it became absolutely clear to me 
that what I really wanted was to write in Portuguese. I even 
wished I had not learned other languages: just so that my 
approach to Portuguese would be virgin and clear.

And here, before continuing this show, it is necessary to make a warning to everyone. At this moment, we find it essential that everyone takes a defined position. Without each one taking a defined position, we cannot continue. It is essential that everyone takes a position, whether to the left or to the right. We even admit that some may take a neutral position, with their arms crossed. But it is necessary that each one, once they have taken their position, stays in it! Because otherwise, companions, the theater chairs creak a lot and no one hears anything.

Weekend at the park

Look at my people in the favelas and you will realize
From here I see a brand new car
Fully equipped and the old man driving
With his children by his side they are going to the park
Euphoric electronic toys
Automatically I imagine
The kids from the area how they are
Probably running around here and there
Playing barefoot soccer in the dirt streets
Yeah, they play the way they can
[...]
Look at that club, how cool
Look at that court, look at that field, look
Look how many people
There's an ice cream shop, cinema, hot pool
[...]
Here I don't see any sports club
No incentive for the kids to attend
The investment in leisure is very scarce
The community center is a failure

On that morning of clear sky and light air, due to the torrential rain of the previous night, I went out for a walk with the sun still hidden to take notice of the first movements of life in the countryside. It didn't take long and the intense smell of coffee brewed by Dona Linda invaded my nostrils and made hunger awaken from that lethargic state derived from the long night of sleep. I put my hands in the water that ran through the bamboo spout and the cold contact gave me goosebumps. But I went on and cupped my hands to my face. With the impact, I stepped back and momentarily lost my breath, but the awakening was immediate. Already awake, I entered the kitchen in search of quenching my hunger and getting close to the warmth of the wood stove. That's when I noticed the slender and discreet figure of a lady accompanied by a boy who seemed to be about five years old already seated at the end of the table in an intimate chat with the lady of the house. After a vigorous 'Good morning!', a warm handshake in the customary introductions, I learned that Dona Flor de Maio was taking her son Ad√£o for treatment of the wounds that were popping up on his body, causing small pustules with reddish edges.",,,"{""questions"":[

 Z√© Ara√∫jo began to sing in a sad tone, telling 
to the curious who began to arrive that a woman 
had knelt at the feet of the holy cross and sworn in 
the name of Jesus a great love, but swore and did not fulfill, 
pretended and deceived me, you lied to me, you sinned against God, the heart has reasons that reason itself 
does not know, makes promises and vows, then forgets.

  The caboclo was sad and inspired. After this 
song that gave Neusa goosebumps, he followed with 
a waltz even more spirited, full of difficult words, 
but beautiful as only the serene drop. It was the story of a 
charming doll seen in a crystal showcase on the 
majestic pedestal. Z√© Ara√∫jo closed his eyes and let 
out his voice:

Her hair had the color/ Of the sun radiating/ 
Fulvous rays of love./ Her eyes were circunvagos/
Of the blue romanticism of lakes/ Lyrical hands, some 
divine arms,/ A white body like no other/ And the feet 
very small./ Finally I saw in this doll/ A perfect 
Venus.

TEXT II

In the summer of 1954, the artist Robert Rauschenberg 
(b.1925) coined the term combine to refer to his 
new works that had aspects of both painting and 
sculpture.

In 1958, Bed was selected to be included in an 
exhibition of young American and Italian artists 
at the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy.
However, the festival organizers refused to 
show the work and removed it to a storage.

While the art world debated the innovation of 
hanging a bed on a wall, Rauschenberg 
considered his work 'one of the most welcoming 
paintings I've ever painted, but I've always been 
afraid someone would want to crawl into it'.

In participation sport or popular sport, the manifestation occurs in the principle of ludic pleasure, which has as its purpose the social well-being of its practitioners. It is closely associated with leisure and free time and occurs in spaces not committed to time and outside the obligations of daily life. It aims at relaxation, fun, personal development and relationship with people. It can be stated that participation sport, being the social dimension of sport most interrelated with democratic paths, balances the framework of inequalities of sports opportunities found in the performance sport dimension.

If, then, for the things we do there is an end 
that we desire for its own sake and everything else is desired 
in the interest of that end; evidently such an end will be the good, 
or rather, the supreme good. But will not knowledge, 
perhaps, have great influence on this life? If so, 
let us strive to determine, even if only in general terms, what it is and from which of the sciences or 
faculties it constitutes the object. No one will doubt that 
its study belongs to the most prestigious art and that 
more truly can be called the master art. 
Now, politics shows to be of this nature, for it is she who 
determines which sciences should be studied 
in a State, which are those that each citizen should 
learn, and to what extent; and we see that even the most esteemed faculties, such as strategy, economics and 
rhetoric, are subject to it. Now, as politics uses 
the other sciences and, on the other hand, legislates on what 
we should and should not do, the purpose of this 
science must encompass those of the others, so that this 
purpose will be the human good.

This is about the progressive loss of productivity of entire biomes, affecting very expressive portions of the sub-humid and semi-arid domains in all hot regions of the world. It is in these ecologically transitional areas that the pressure on biomass is strongly felt, due to the removal of forest cover, overgrazing, and uncontrolled mining activities, triggering an acute environmental degradation scenario, reflected by the inability to support the development of plant species, whether a natural forest or agricultural plantations.

A society is a more or less self-sufficient association of people who in their mutual relations recognize certain rules of conduct as obligatory and who, most of the time, act accordingly. A society is well-ordered not only when it is planned to promote the well-being of its members, but also when it is effectively regulated by a public conception of justice. That is, it is a society in which everyone accepts, and knows that others accept, the same principle of justice.

A person finds himself forced by necessity to borrow money. He knows very well that he will not be able to pay, but also sees that they will not lend him anything if he does not promise firmly to pay within a specified period. Feels tempted to make the promise; but still has enough conscience to ask himself: is it not forbidden and contrary to duty to get out of trouble in this way? Assuming that he decides to do so, his maxim of action would be: when I think I am in financial trouble, I will borrow it and promise to pay it back, although I know that this will never happen.

The 8.8 Richter scale earthquake that hit the west coast of Chile in February caused significant changes in the region's map. According to a preliminary analysis, the entire city of Concepci√≥n shifted at least three meters to the west. Buenos Aires moved about 2.5 centimeters to the west, while Santiago, closer to the event location, shifted almost 30 centimeters to the west-southwest. The cities of Valpara√≠so, in Chile, and Mendoza, in Argentina, also had their positions significantly altered (13.4 centimeters and 8.8 centimeters, respectively).

The vast majority of democratic Western countries 
have adopted the Constitutional Court as a mechanism 
to control the other powers. The inclusion of the Courts 
in the political scenario implied changes in the calculation 
for the implementation of public policies. The government, 
besides negotiating its political plan with the Parliament, 
had to worry about not infringing the Constitution. 
This new institutional architecture 
has led to the development of a political environment that enabled 
the Judiciary's participation in decision-making processes.

The largest consumers of logistics infrastructure for export in Brazil are bulk products, among which stand out iron ore, oil and its derivatives, and soybeans, which, due to their low added value, and being moved in large volumes, require large-scale and low-cost infrastructure. In the case of soybeans, the infrastructure leaves much to be desired, resulting in huge queues of ships, trucks, and trains, which, as they remain idle in the queues for much of the time, have their costs increased, heavily burdening the exporter, affecting their profit margin and threatening our international competitiveness.

We seek to demonstrate that development can be seen as a process of expanding real freedoms that people enjoy. The focus on human freedoms contrasts with more restrictive views of development, such as those that identify development with growth of the Gross National Product, or industrialization. The growth of the GNP can be very important as a means of expanding freedoms. But freedoms also depend on other determinants, such as education and health services and civil rights.

scientists from around the world that disqualified

Well, it was in the 18th century - in 1789, precisely - 
that a Constituent Assembly produced and proclaimed 
in Paris the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of 
the Citizen. This Declaration was imposed as necessary 
for a group of revolutionaries, as it was prepared

In the beginning was the Word. The sentence that opens the first chapter of the Gospel of John and refers to the creation of the world, as Genesis also does, is the most famous in the Bible. The idea that the world is created by the word, however, is so structuring that it is present in other religions, far beyond those founded in Christianity. As humans, language is the world we inhabit. Just try to imagine a world where we cannot use words to talk about ourselves and others to understand what that means. Or a world where what you say is not understood by others, and what others say is not understood by you.
What happens then when the word is destroyed and, with it, language?
For centuries, in different societies and languages, it is important to remember, language has served ‚Äî and still serves ‚Äî to maintain privileges of powerful groups and leave everyone else out. Who understands the language of lawyers, judges, and prosecutors, the language of doctors, the language of bureaucrats, the language of scientists? Most of the population has been subjected to the violence of being deliberately prevented from understanding the language of those who determine their destinies.
If the beginning is the Word, the end can be silence. Even if it is filled with screams among those who no longer have a common language to understand each other. []",,,"{""questions"":[

Soropita began to retell the chapter of the soap opera. Without effort, he remembered the words, even clearly - he was amazed by that.

The pessimist
Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez
Gerineldo sleeps because he is already resigned to his world. Because he already knows everything that can happen to him after subjecting all the objects around him to a meticulous inventory of possibilities. His apartment, more than an apartment, is a theory of luck and misfortune. Better than anyone, Gerineldo knows the coefficient of expansion of his windows and keeps marked on the thermometer, with a red line, the point at which the glass will break, shattered into shards of death. He knows that architects and engineers have already predicted everything, except what has never happened before.

From the 1950s to the 1970s, this event, then called Cavalaria, was celebrated by people living in the rural area of the municipality of Caic√≥. These people used animals (donkeys, mules, and horses) as their only means of transportation, especially to go to the city on market days, bringing their products to sell. Being in Caic√≥ during the Feast of Sant'Ana, these farmers organized a cavalcade to the courtyard of the Cathedral of Sant'Ana to praise the saint and receive blessings for their animals. Around the 1970s, with the arrival of cars in the rural area of the municipality, this cultural expression was extinguished.

This occurs due to the union of a gamete containing one chromosome 21 with a gamete containing two chromosome 21. Although women with the syndrome are usually sterile, in 2008, in the countryside of S√£o Paulo, one of them gave birth to a girl without Down syndrome.
Knowing this, a young couple, both with this syndrome, seek a specialist doctor for genetic counseling because they want to have a baby. []",,,"{""questions"":[

101,NATURAL SCIENCES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"## Cyanide Toxicity
### Molecular Biology of the Cell
ATP production depends on the proton gradient generated by the respiratory chain. In these reactions, according to the scheme, electrons from the oxidation of NADH to positively charged NAD travel through the chain until they reach cytochrome c oxidase, reducing the iron from a 3 positive charge to a 2 positive charge. Oxygen acts as the final acceptor of these electrons, forming water. Cyanide is a highly toxic chemical species that has a high affinity for the 3 positive charge iron. When cells are exposed to cyanide, it binds to the 3 positive charge iron site of cytochrome c oxidase, preventing its conversion to a 2 positive charge iron and blocking the respiratory chain.

104,NATURAL SCIENCES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"## Ancient Soil Chemists of the Amazon
Amazonian soils, rich in silicate, are not suitable for cultivation because they are unable to retain nutrients. However, archaeological discoveries have shown that the ancient inhabitants of the Amazon mastered the technique of preparing a natural agricultural input, called black earth. This input consisted mainly of a type of biochar obtained from the burning of organic matter, such as tree trunks, pieces of bones, and manure, capable of keeping the soil fertile for years.
It is admitted that the effect of biochar on soil fertilization was, in part, related to the presence of carboxylate organic groups on its surface, negatively charged (single COO bond with negative charge). These groups attract positive ions necessary as nutrients, such as those from potassium, calcium, and magnesium, as well as micronutrients, such as zinc and iron. This bond in the fertilized soil is predominantly ionic, as illustrated in the figure, where M of positive charge n represents the metallic cations. According to the Pauling scale, the electronegativity of the oxygen element is equal to 3.44.

The high temperature causes the vaporization of all the contents inside this type of bottle, increasing the pressure inside it until culminating in the explosion of the packaging.
Suppose a metallic aerosol bottle with a capacity of 100 milliliters, containing 0.1 mol of gaseous products at a temperature of 650 degrees Celsius at the time of the explosion.

Recently, accurate measurements of ionizing radiation doses were taken for flights between Rio de Janeiro and Rome. The results have indicated that the average dose of radiation received during the cruise phase (which usually represents 80 percent of the total flight time) of this intercontinental route is 2 microsieverts per hour.
