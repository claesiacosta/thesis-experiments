Some time ago I realized that, since my early years, I had received many false opinions as true, and that what I later founded on such poorly secured principles could only be very doubtful and uncertain. It was necessary to seriously try, once in my life, to get rid of all the opinions to which I had previously given credit, and start all over again in order to establish a firm and unshakable knowledge.

Hence arises a question: whether it is better to be loved than feared, or feared than loved.

No one is unaware of the need that all 
farmers have to increase the number of their 
workers. And how did farmers supply the necessary labor until recently? Farms were 
supplied by the acquisition of slaves, without the 
slightest financial aid from the government. Now, if farmers supplied labor at their own expense, and if it is still possible to obtain it, albeit of a different quality, why should they not seek to obtain it in the same way, that is, 
at their own expense?

For example, cannibal females of the insect known as praying mantis, Tenodera aridofolia, have up to 63% of their diet composed of male partners. For females, sexual cannibalism can ensure the acquisition of important nutrients in reproduction. With this increase in the diet, they generally produce a greater quantity of eggs.

To provide accessibility to people with mobility difficulties, hydraulic lifts are used in buses and cars. In this device, an electric pump is used to force a fluid to pass from a narrow pipe to a wider one, and thus activate a piston that moves the platform. Consider a hydraulic lift whose piston head area is five times larger than the area of the pipe coming out of the pump. Disregarding friction and considering a gravitational acceleration of 10 m/s², it is desired to lift a person weighing 65 kg in a 15 kg wheelchair on a 20 kg platform.

The warfarin is a drug that decreases platelet aggregation, and therefore is used as an anticoagulant, provided that it is present in the plasma, with a concentration greater than 1.0 mg/L. However, plasma concentrations above 4.0 mg/L can trigger hemorrhages. The molecules of this drug are retained in the intravascular space and dissolved exclusively in the plasma, which represents approximately 60% of the blood volume.

New technologies

Currently, there is a prevailing discourse in the media about the exaltation of new technologies, especially those related to telecommunications. Common expressions such as 'the future has already arrived', 'technological wonders' and 'total connection with the world' 'fetishize' new products, turning them into objects of desire, of mandatory consumption. For this reason, today we carry in our pockets, bags, and backpacks the so much celebrated 'future'. However, we cannot reduce ourselves to mere victims of a perverse media device, or of a controlling capitalist device. There is perversion, certainly, and control, without a doubt. However, we have developed a symbiotic relationship of mutual dependence with the media vehicles, which tightens with each shared image and with each personal dossier transformed into a public object of entertainment.

No longer like those chained in Plato's cave, we are free to imprison ourselves, by spontaneous will, in this sadomasochistic relationship with the media structures, in which we both control and are controlled.

Until when?

There's no use looking at the sky 
With a lot of faith and little struggle 
Get up, you have a lot of protests to make 
And a lot of strikes, you can, you must, believe me 
There's no use looking at the ground 
Turning your face away not to see 
Pay attention, they put you on a cross and just because Jesus 
Suffered doesn't mean you have to suffer!

Playing fair

Arguing is not winning a discussion at any cost. Convincing someone of something is, first and foremost, an alternative to the practice of winning an issue by shouting or physical violence - or non-physical. Non-physical, colon. A politician who blatantly lies can captivate voters. An advertisement that plays dirty can embarrass crowds into consuming a product harmful to the environment. There are psychological manipulations not only in religion. And it is common for people to act emotionally, because they are victims of cunning - and neck-hugging - seduction. Although effectiveness at all costs is not arguing, nor is it about admitting only scientific truths - forming an opinion only after seeing the demonstration and evidence, as science does. Arguing is a matter of everyday life, a form of rhetoric, but it is a reasoning that tries to convince without becoming mere manipulative calculation, and it can be rigorous without being scientific.

It is evident that vitamin D is important — but how to get it? Really, vitamin D can be naturally produced by exposure to sunlight, but it also exists in some common foods. However, as a source of this vitamin, certain foods are better than others. Some have a significant amount of vitamin D naturally, and are foods that you may not want to overdo: butter, cream, egg yolk, and liver.

We all know that vitamin D (cholecalciferol) is crucial for your health. But is vitamin D really a vitamin? Is it present in the foods that humans normally consume? Although it exists to some extent in fish fat, vitamin D is not in our diets, unless humans artificially enhance a food product, such as vitamin D enriched milk. Nature planned for you to produce it in your skin, not to put it directly in your mouth.

The bit in the Gutenberg galaxy

In this century, writing shares ground with various means of communication. This issue makes us think about the need for the 'interweaving, coexistence, and reciprocal interpretation of the various circuits of knowledge production and dissemination...'

It is necessary to relativize our stance towards modern technologies, especially computing. It is an innovative field, no doubt, but its foundations are in previous informative models, including, in the oral tradition and in the natural ability to mentally simulate events in the world and anticipate the consequences of our actions. Printing is the matrix that triggered this entire electronic communication process. I emphasize, therefore, the kinship between the computer and other means of communication, especially writing, a view of computing as a 'development of what printed literary production and, previously, the oral tradition already carried within them.'

Blanket that sews tales and stories within 
a family serves as a metaphor for memory in a work 
written by a Portuguese author

What could be worth more than the blanket for 
that family? Famous painters' paintings? Queen's jewels? Palaces? A blanket made of hundreds of 
scraps of old clothes warmed the children's feet 
and the grandmother's memory, who with each square pointed out by 
her grandchildren rescued a story from her memories. 
Fantasy stories like the one of the dress with a pocket 
that housed a cookie-eating gnome; mischievous stories like the shorts 
transformed into rags on the day the boy, who liked to ride 
his bike with his eyes closed, broke his arm; stories 
of longing, like the apron that carried a letter 
for over a month... Many stories formed that 
blanket. The protagonists were family members, an uncle, 
aunt, grandfather, great-grandmother, herself, the former owners 
of the clothes. One day, the grandmother died, and the aunts started 
to dispute the blanket, they all wanted it, more than the 
paintings, jewels, and palaces left by her. Fortunately, the aunts managed to reach an agreement, and the blanket started 
to stay each month at one of their houses. And the scraps, 
as they ran out, were replaced by 
other scraps, and new and old stories were being 
incorporated into the most valuable blanket in the world.

Sick, I think between sneezes about how the word 
flu came to us after a series of contagions among 
languages. The epidemic of flu 
that spread throughout Europe started in Italy in 1743, in addition to the virus itself, two viral words: the Italian influenza and the French 
grippe. The first was a term derived from medieval Latin influentia, which meant 'influence of the stars 
on men'. The second was just the nominal form 
of the verb gripper, that is, 'to grab'. It is assumed that it referred to the violent way the virus takes hold of the infected organism.

Chapter LIV - The pendulum

I left there savoring the kiss. I couldn't sleep; I lay in bed, it's true, but it was as if nothing had happened. I heard
all the hours of the night. Usually, when I couldn't sleep, the ticking of the pendulum made me very uneasy; that somber, slow, and dry tick-tock seemed to say with each stroke that I was going to have one less moment of life. I then imagined an old devil, sitting between two bags, one of life and one of death, and counting them like this:

- One less...
- One less...
- One less...
- One less...
The most peculiar thing is that, if the clock stopped, I would wind it up so that it would never stop ticking, and I could count all my lost moments. There are inventions that change or end; the same institutions die; the clock is definitive and perpetual. The last man, bidding farewell to the cold and worn-out sun, must have a clock in his pocket, to know the exact time of his death.
That night I did not suffer from that sad feeling of boredom, but from another, and delightful. Fantasies tumultuated inside me, they came one after the other, like devotees jostling to see the angel-singer of processions. I did not hear the lost moments, but the gained minutes.

For Carr, the internet acts in the commerce of distraction

Author of 'The Shallows' analyzes the influence

of technology on the mind

American journalist Nicholas Carr believes that the
internet does not stimulate anyone's intelligence. The author
explains scientific discoveries about the functioning of the
human brain and theorizes about the influence of the internet
on our way of thinking.

For him, the network makes the reasoning of those who navigate
more shallow, in addition to fragmenting the attention of its users.
Moreover: Carr asserts that there are companies profiting
from the recent fragility of our attention. 'The more
time we spend online and the faster we move from one
information to another, the more money
internet companies make,' he evaluates.

'These companies are in the commerce of distraction and
are experts in keeping us increasingly hungry for
information fragmented into small parts. It is clear
that they have an interest in stimulating us and taking advantage
of our compulsion for technology.'

avoid the overly continental tone of the young woman, which is 
a word that is already giving me a headache

The Spanish sociologist Manuel Castells argues that 
“the communication of values and mobilization around 
meaning are fundamental. Cultural movements 
(understood as movements that aim to defend or propose 
their own ways of life and meaning) are built around communication systems — 
essentially the internet and the media 
— because this is the main way these movements 
find to reach those people who may 
eventually share their values, and from here 
act on society's consciousness as a whole”.

An industry has a water reservoir with a capacity of 900 m³. When there is a need to clean the reservoir, all the water needs to be drained. The water drainage is done through six drains and takes 6 hours when the reservoir is full. This industry will build a new reservoir, with a capacity of 500 m³, whose water drainage should be done in 4 hours when the reservoir is full. The drains used in the new reservoir should be identical to those in the existing one.

One of the major problems faced on Brazilian highways is the excess of load carried by trucks. Designed for traffic within legal load limits, the road surface deteriorates with the excessive weight of the trucks. In addition, the excess load interferes with the braking capacity and suspension operation of the vehicle, frequent causes of accidents.
","
Aware of this responsibility and based on the experience gained from weighings, a truck driver knows that his truck can carry a maximum of 1,500 tiles or 1,200 bricks.
Considering this truck loaded with 900 tiles, how many bricks, at most, can be added to the load so as not to exceed the maximum load of the truck?

Since 1,200 bricks are equivalent to 600 tiles, divide 600 by 2 to find out how many bricks can be added: 600 / 2 = 300 bricks. Therefore, 300 bricks can be added to the load, making a total of 900 tiles + 300 bricks = 1200 bricks, which is the maximum load of the truck."
