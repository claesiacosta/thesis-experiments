Researchers were able to stimulate the absorption of 
light energy in plants thanks to the use of carbon 
nanotubes. For this, carbon nanotubes “inserted” themselves 
inside the chloroplasts through a spontaneous assembly, 
across the chloroplast membranes. Plant pigments absorb 
light radiation, electrons are “excited” and move within 
the chloroplast membranes, and the plant then uses this 
electric energy to produce sugars. Carbon nanotubes can absorb wavelengths 
usually not used by chloroplasts, and researchers had the idea 
of using them as “antennas”, stimulating the conversion of solar energy by 
chloroplasts, with increased electron transport.

For a season of Formula 1 races, the fuel tank capacity of each car became 100 kg of gasoline. A team chose to use gasoline with a density of 750 grams per liter, starting the race with a full tank. At the first refueling stop, a car from this team showed a record on its onboard computer indicating the consumption of four tenths of the gasoline originally in the tank. To minimize the weight of this car and ensure the end of the race, the support team refueled the car with one third of what was left in the tank upon arrival at the refueling station.

solar panels in the parking areas and on the roof

approximately 300 m² of panels will be placed, with 100 m² for generating electrical energy used on the

Romans used social networks two thousand years ago, says book

When tweeting or commenting below the post of one of your 
several friends on Facebook, you probably feel 
privileged to live in a time in history when it is 
possible to immediately reach a vast network of 
contacts through a simple click on the 'send' button. 
You may also reflect on how past generations could live without social media, devoid 
of the ability to see and be seen, to receive, generate 
and interact with a huge amount of information. But what 
you may not know is that humans have been using 
social interaction tools for over two thousand years. 
This is what Tom Standage, author of the book Writing on the 
Wall - Social Media, The first 2 000 Years, claims.

According to Standage, Marcus Tullius Cicero, Roman philosopher and 
politician, would have been, along with other members of the 
Roman elite, a precursor in the use of social networks. The author 
recounts how Cicero used a slave, who later 
became his scribe, to write messages on papyrus scrolls 
that were sent to a kind of network of 
contacts. These people, in turn, copied his text, 
added their own comments and passed it on. 'Today we have computers and broadband, but the 
Romans had slaves and scribes who transmitted their 
messages,' Standage told BBC Brazil. 'Members 
of the Roman elite constantly wrote to each other, 
commenting on the latest political movements and 
expressing opinions.'

In addition to papyrus, another platform commonly used 
by the Romans was a wax tablet the size and shape of a 
modern tablet, on which they wrote messages, 
questions or transmitted the main points of the acta 
diurna, a 'newspaper' displayed daily in the Forum of 
Rome. This tablet, the 'Ancient Rome iPad', was taken 
by a messenger to the recipient, who replied 
below the message.

Texts and hypertexts: seeking balance
There is a fear on the part of parents and some teachers that children will unlearn when browsing, fear of them becoming addicted, of obtaining unreliable information, of isolating themselves from the real world, as if the computer were an agent of evil, a villain. This fear is reinforced by the media, which usually presents the computer as a negative agent in learning and in the socialization of users. We know that no one is at risk of unlearning when browsing, whether in digital environments or in printed materials, but it is necessary to see what is being learned and sometimes interfere in this process in order to optimize or guide learning, showing users other themes, other paths, other possibilities different from those they found on their own or those they usually use. It is necessary, sometimes, to negotiate the use so that it is not exclusive, since there are other means of communication, other means of information, and other leisure alternatives. It is a matter of balancing and not blaming.

But as soon as we enter the web universe, we discover that it constitutes not only a rapidly expanding 'territory', but also offers numerous 'maps', filters, selections to help the navigator orient themselves. The best guide for the web is the web itself. Even though it may be necessary to have the patience to explore it.

TEXT II

Another interpretation is made based on the social conditions of that time. For the nanny and for the child
for whom the song was sung, the music spoke of marriage as a natural destiny in a woman's life, in Brazilian society of the 19th century, marked by patriarchy. The music prepares the girl for her destiny not only as inexorable, but desirable: marriage, establishing a hierarchy of obedience (father, older brother, husband), according to the time and circumstances of her life.

These young ladies had the habit of stating the opposite of what they desired. I noticed the singularity when they began to praise my monkey-colored jacket. They examined it seriously, found the fabric and trimmings of superior quality, the admirable workmanship. I became vain: I had never noticed such advantages. But the compliments continued, brought me suspicion. I finally realized that they were mocking and I did not get offended. Far from it: I found curious that way of speaking in reverse, different from the rudeness to which I was accustomed. In general, they told me frankly that the clothes did not fit me, they were loose under the armpits.

The Tupi language in Brazil

300 years ago, living in the village of São Paulo de Piratininga (dried fish, in Tupi) was almost synonymous with speaking the Indian language. Out of every five inhabitants of the city, only two knew Portuguese. Therefore, in 1698, the governor of the province, Artur de Sá e Meneses, begged Portugal to only send priests who knew 'the general language of the Indians', because 'those people do not explain themselves in another language'.

Derived from the dialect of São Vicente, the Tupi of São Paulo developed and spread in the 17th century, thanks to the geographical isolation of the city and the unchristian activity of the Paulista mamelucos: the bandeiras, expeditions to the backlands in search of Indian slaves. Many bandeirantes did not even speak Portuguese or expressed themselves poorly. Domingos Jorge Velho, the Paulista who destroyed the Quilombo dos Palmares in 1694, was described by the bishop of Pernambuco as 'a barbarian who doesn't even know how to speak'. In their wanderings, these people baptized places like Avanhandava (place where the Indian runs), Pindamonhangaba (place to make a fishing hook), and Itu (waterfall). And ended up inventing a new language.
'The slaves of the bandeirantes came from more than 100 different tribes,' says historian and anthropologist John Monteiro, from the State University of Campinas. 'This changed the Paulista Tupi, which, in addition to the influence of Portuguese, also received words from other languages.' The result of the mixture became known as the general language of the south, a kind of simplified Tupi.

The reveler

When Admiral Cabral
Set foot in Brazil
The guardian angel of the Indians
Was strolling in Paris.
When he returned from his trip
The Dutchman was already here.
The angel breathes happily:
""It doesn't matter, these are good people,
I'll air out again.""
The angel crossed the bar,
Says goodbye to Pernambuco,
Makes noise, vuco-vuco,
Just like the zeppelin
But a wind hit the angel,
He lost his memory...
And never came back.

But it was one night, that Saturday night of October 21, 1967, that stopped our country. Stopped to watch the final of the III Record Festival, when a 24-year-old young man named Eduardo Lobo, Edu Lobo, left the Paramount Theater in São Paulo after winning the festival's top prize with Ponteio, which he sang accompanied by the charming and beginner Marília Medalha.

It was that night that Chico Buarque sang his Roda viva alongside MPB-4 of Magro, the arranger. That Caetano Veloso shone singing Alegria, alegria with the audience to the sound of the Beat Boys' guitars, that Gilberto Gil presented the tropicalist Domingo no parque with the Mutantes.

That night that ended up becoming a movie, in 2010, in the hands of Renato Terra and Ricardo Calil, has now become a book. The book being launched now is the story of that night, expanded and in a state that in journalistic jargon we call raw material. Those who saw the movie will delight in the stories - and some gossip - that each one has to tell, now without the necessary cuts that a movie requires. And those who did not see the movie have before them a book of stories, thinking well, of History.

Despite many children and teenagers having Barbie as an example of beauty, an infographic made by the website Rehabs.com proved that, if a woman had the measurements of the plastic doll, she wouldn't even be alive.

It's not exactly news that the proportions of the world's most famous doll are absurd for the real world. Activists fighting for a healthier self-image, researchers of eating disorders, and people concerned about the impact of cultural industry on the human psyche have been pointing out for years the influence of models like Barbie on the distortion of the female body.

Neck
With a neck twice as long and 15 centimeters thinner than that of a woman, Barbie would be unable to keep her head up.

Waist
With a waist of 40 centimeters (smaller than her head), the real-life Barbie would only have room in her body to accommodate half a kidney and a few centimeters of intestine.

Hips
The ratio measuring the relationship between Barbie's waist and hips is 0.56, which means that the measurement of her waist represents 56% of the circumference of her hips. This same ratio, in an average American woman, is 0.8.

Declaration of love

This is a confession of love: I love the Portuguese language. 
It is not easy. It is not malleable. [...] The Portuguese language is 
a real challenge for those who write. Especially for 
those who write by removing the first layer of superficiality from things and people. 

Sometimes it reacts to a more complicated thought. Sometimes it is scared by the unpredictable 
of a sentence. I like to handle it - as I liked to be mounted on a horse and guide it by the reins, sometimes 
at a gallop. I wanted the Portuguese language to reach 
its maximum potential in my hands. And this desire is shared by all who write. A Camões and others alike were not enough 
to give us a ready-made language heritage forever. 
All of us who write are turning the tomb of thought into something that gives it life.

We have these difficulties. But I didn't mention 
the enchantment of dealing with a language that has not been 
profound. What I inherited is not enough for me. 

If I were mute and also couldn't write, and 
they asked me which language I wanted to belong to, I would say: 
English, which is precise and beautiful. But, since I was not born mute and 
could write, it became absolutely clear to me 
that what I really wanted was to write in Portuguese. I even 
wished I hadn't learned other languages: just so that my 
approach to Portuguese would be pure and clear.","
The passage in which Clarice Lispector declares her love for the 
Portuguese language, emphasizing its heritage nature and 
its capacity for renewal, is:","{'A': ' “The Portuguese language is a real challenge for those who write.”\n', 'B': ' “A Camões and others alike were not enough to give us a ready-made language heritage forever.”\n', 'C': ' “All of us who write are turning the tomb of thought into something that gives it life.”\n', 'D': ' “But I didn't mention the enchantment of dealing with a language that has not been profound.”\n', 'E': ' “I even wished I hadn't learned other languages: just so that my approach to Portuguese would be pure and clear.”\n\n'}",{'B': ' “A Camões and others alike were not enough to give us a ready-made language heritage forever.”\n'},No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,,,,,"LANGUAGES, CODES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES",YELLOW,{B:  “A Camões and others alike were not enough to give us a ready-made language heritage forever.”},The passage mentions that 'A Camões and others alike were not enough to give us a ready-made language heritage forever.'

On that morning of clear sky and light air, due to the torrential rain of the previous night, I went out for a walk with the sun still hidden to take notice of the first movements of life in the countryside.

Already awake, I entered the kitchen in search of quenching my hunger and getting close to the warmth of the wood stove. It was when I noticed the slender and discreet figure of a lady accompanied by a boy around five years old already seated at the end of the table in intimate conversation with the lady of the house. After a vigorous 'Good morning!', a warm handshake in the customary introductions, I learned that Dona Flor de Maio was taking her son Adão for treatment of the wounds that were popping up on his body, causing small pustules with reddish edges.","

A kind of disgust and repulsion tinged their faces, they no longer ate with the same satisfaction and refused to praise the minced lamb pastries, the cream and date pastries, and the golden almond rice, exuding a smell of toasted onion. That woman, sitting silently with a face traced with wrinkles, was capable of taking away the flavor and smell of food and suppressing the voice and gesture as if her silence or her presence, which was only silence, prevented the other from living.

I like to say. I will say it better: I like to word.
Words are for me touchable bodies, visible sirens, incorporated sensuality.

I shudder if they say it well. Such a page of Fialho, such a page of Chateaubriand, make my whole life tingle in all veins, make me rage tremulously quietly of an unattainable pleasure that I am having.

In participation sport or popular sport, the manifestation occurs in the principle of playful pleasure, which aims at the social well-being of its practitioners. It is closely associated with leisure and free time and occurs in spaces not committed to time and outside the obligations of daily life. It aims at relaxation, fun, personal development and relationship with people. It can be stated that participation sport, being the social dimension of sport most interrelated with democratic paths, balances the framework of inequalities of sports opportunities found in the performance sport dimension. While performance sport only allows success to talents or those who had conditions, participation sport favors pleasure to all who wish to take part in it.

If, then, for the things we do there is an end 
that we desire for its own sake and everything else is desired 
in the interest of that end; evidently such an end will be the good, 
or rather, the supreme good. But will not knowledge, 
perhaps, have great influence on this life? If so, 
let us strive to determine, even if only in general terms, what it is and from which of the sciences or 
faculties it constitutes the object. No one will doubt that 
its study belongs to the most prestigious art and that 
which can most truly be called the master art. 
Now, politics shows to be of this nature, for it is she who 
determines which sciences should be studied 
in a State, which are those that each citizen should 
learn, and to what extent; and we see that even the most esteemed faculties, such as strategy, economics and 
rhetoric, are subject to it. Now, as politics uses 
the other sciences and, on the other hand, legislates on what 
we should and should not do, the purpose of this 
science must encompass those of the others, so that this

Solon is the first Greek name that comes to mind when land and debt are mentioned together.

The concept of democracy, in Habermas' thought, is built from a procedural dimension based on discourse and deliberation. Democratic legitimacy requires that the process of political decision-making occurs from a broad public discussion, only then deciding. Thus, the deliberative character corresponds to a collective process of weighing and analysis, permeated by discourse, which precedes the decision.

A person finds himself forced by necessity to borrow money. He knows very well that he will not be able to pay, but also sees that they will not lend him anything if he does not firmly promise to pay within a specified period. Feels tempted to make the promise; but still has enough consciousness to ask himself: is it not forbidden and contrary to duty to get out of trouble in this way? Assuming that he decides to do so, his maxim of action would be: when I think I am in financial trouble, I will borrow it and promise to pay it back, although I know that this will never happen.

Dear Citizens,
The aging population is a global phenomenon. Unfortunately, our country is not yet prepared to meet the demands of this population.
This is the picture of public health in Brazil, which, despite undeniable advances, presents a scenario of deficiencies and lack of integration at all levels of health care: primary (poor care in basic health units), secondary (lack of reference centers with specialist care) and tertiary (hospital care focused on the disease in the elderly), in other words, there is no, in practice, a health care network for the elderly.
Faced with this scenario, the Brazilian Society of Geriatrics and Gerontology (SBGG) publicly expresses its concerns about the present and future of the elderly in Brazil. Health must be guaranteed as a universal right.

In the beginning was the Word. The sentence that opens the first chapter of the Gospel of John and refers to the creation of the world, as Genesis also does, is the most famous in the Bible. The idea that the world is created by the word, however, is so structuring that it is present in other religions, far beyond those founded in Christianity. As humans, language is the world we inhabit. Just try to imagine a world where we cannot use words to talk about ourselves and others to understand what that means. Or a world in which what you say is not understood by others, and what others say is not understood by you.
What happens then when the word is destroyed and, with it, language?
For centuries, in different societies and languages, it is important to remember, language has served — and still serves — to maintain privileges of powerful groups and leave everyone else out. Who understands the language of lawyers, judges, and prosecutors, the language of doctors, the language of bureaucrats, the language of scientists? Most of the population has been subjected to the violence of being deliberately prevented from understanding the language of those who determine their destinies.

That's how they were having dinner, the people from the village came to receive the new part of the radio soap opera. They had already heard everything once, it was out of the ordinary: the truck of a buyer of chickens and eggs had failed there in Ão the day before, Mr. Abrãozinho Buristém, who was carrying a small battery-powered radio, had set up a wire on the wire fence... But they wanted to listen again, for confirmation. - ""The story is stable and good, even though it's long: it throws and doesn't yield..."" - Zuz explained to Dalberto.
Soropita began to retell the chapter of the soap opera. Without effort, he remembered the words, even clearly - he was amazed by that.

The pessimist
Gabriel García Márquez
Gerineldo sleeps because he is already resigned to his world. Because he already knows everything that can happen to him after subjecting all the objects around him to a meticulous inventory of possibilities. His apartment, more than an apartment, is a theory of luck and misfortune. Better than anyone, Gerineldo knows the coefficient of expansion of his windows and keeps marked on the thermometer, with a red line, the point at which the glass will break, shattered into shards of death. He knows that architects and engineers have already predicted everything, except what has never happened before.

Jean-Paul Sartre
The situation is the whole subject (he is nothing but his situation) and is also the whole thing (there is never anything but things). It is the subject elucidating things by its own overcoming, if we wish; or it is things sending back to the subject his image. It is total facticity, the absolute contingency of the world, of my birth, of my place, of my past, of my surroundings — and it is my limitless freedom that makes facticity exist for me.

During the French Revolution, a certain priest Niollant hid in the small castle of L’Escarbas. He paid generously for the hospitality of the old nobleman by taking care of his daughter's education, Anaïs.

The priest passed on to the student his fearlessness of opinions and his ease of judgment, without thinking that these qualities, so necessary in a man, become defects in a woman destined for the humble tasks of a family mother.

The Jewish presence in Brazil gradually created certain suspicions that were reflected in press organs and in intellectual and political circles.

This is done based on the relationship between the remaining carbon-14 in the fossil and the amount of carbon-14 in a similar current species. Despite undergoing radioactive decay, the amount of carbon-14 in the atmosphere, particularly in CO2 molecules, is practically constant, due to the incidence of cosmic rays constantly hitting the Earth. Thus, as part of the carbon cycle, animals and plants maintain a practically constant amount of carbon-14 in their constitution while they are alive. However, when they die, the entry of carbon into the organism ceases and this number decreases as carbon-14 decays radioactively.

Cosmic rays are sources of potentially dangerous ionizing radiation for the human body.

Calculate the total sheets needed for 1,150 students: 1,150 students / 100 sheets = 11.5 packages. Each package costs 4 reais, so the total cost without discount is 11.5 * 4 = 46 reais. Since the principal can only spend 220 reais, the discount needed is 220 - 46 = 174 reais. To find the percentage discount, calculate (discount / total cost) * 100 = (174 / 220) * 100 = 79%. The interval that contains 79% is (11.5 ; 12.5), so the answer is (11.5 ; 12.5)."

The ideal is to consume 1 gram of carbohydrate for each minute of walking. A couple will perform 30 minutes of walking daily, ingesting, before this activity, the recommended ideal amount of carbohydrates. To have the ideal consumption only through the consumption of whole wheat bread, the couple plans to ensure the supply of bread for a period of 30 uninterrupted days. It is known that each package of this bread comes with 18 slices, and each of them has 15 grams of carbohydrates.",The minimum amount of packages of whole wheat bread needed to provide the supply to this couple is,"{'A': '1.', 'B': '4.', 'C': '6.', 'D': '7.', 'E': '8.'}",{'D': '7.'},,,,,,,No,False,True,[],,MATHEMATICS AND ITS TECHNOLOGIES,ORANGE,{C: 6.},"To calculate the minimum amount of packages of whole wheat bread needed, first find the total grams of carbohydrates needed for 30 minutes of walking: 1 gram/minute * 30 minutes = 30 grams. Then, calculate the total number of slices needed: 30 grams / 15 grams/slice = 2 slices. Since each package has 18 slices, divide the total slices needed by slices per package: 2 slices / 18 slices/package = 0.111. Since we can't have a fraction of a package, round up to the nearest whole number, which is 1 package. Therefore, the minimum amount of packages needed is 6."
178,2023,"The Mayan calendar presents two simultaneous year counts, the so-called Tzolkim year, composed of 260 days and determining the religious calendar, and the Haab year, composed of 365 days and determining the agricultural calendar. A historian found evidence that generations of the same family ruled a certain Mayan community for a period of 20 cycles, each cycle consisting of 52 Haab years.","According to the information provided, for how many Tzolkim years was that Mayan community ruled by such family?","{'A': '741', 'B': '1 040', 'C': '1 460', 'D': '2 100', 'E': '5 200'}",{'C': '1 460'},,,,,,,No,False,True,[],,MATHEMATICS AND ITS TECHNOLOGIES,ORANGE,{C: 1 460},"To find out for how many Tzolkim years the Mayan community was ruled by the family, we need to calculate the total number of Haab years first. Since each cycle consists of 52 Haab years, and there were 20 cycles, the total number of Haab years is 52 * 20 = 1040. To convert Haab years to Tzolkim years, we divide the total Haab years by 365 (the number of days in a Haab year) to get Tzolkim years. Therefore, 1040 / 260 = 4. Hence, the Mayan community was ruled by the family for 1,460 Tzolkim years."
