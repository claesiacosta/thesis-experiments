Researchers were able to stimulate the absorption of 
light energy in plants thanks to the use of carbon 
nanotubes. For this, carbon nanotubes “inserted” themselves 
inside the chloroplasts through a spontaneous assembly, 
through the chloroplast membranes. Plant pigments absorb 
light radiation, electrons are “excited” and move inside 
the chloroplast membranes, and the plant then uses 
this electrical energy to produce sugars.
Carbon nanotubes can absorb wavelengths usually not used by chloroplasts,

“antennas”, stimulating the conversion of solar energy by 
chloroplasts, with an increase in electron transport.

The message typed on the cell phone, while you drive, takes your attention away and, therefore, should be avoided. Research shows that a driver who drives a car at a constant speed travels 'blindly' (that is, without seeing the road) a distance proportional to the time spent looking at the cell phone while typing the message. Consider that this actually happens. Suppose that two drivers (X and Y) drive at the same constant speed and type the same message on their cell phones. Suppose, furthermore, that the time spent by driver X looking at his cell phone while typing the message corresponds to 25% of the time spent by driver Y to perform the same task.

Romans used social networks two thousand years ago, says book

When tweeting or commenting below the post of one of your 
several friends on Facebook, you probably feel 
privileged to live in a time in history when it is 
possible to immediately reach a vast network of 
contacts through a simple click on the 'send' button. 
You may also reflect on how 
past generations could live without social media, devoid 
of the ability to see and be seen, to receive, generate 
and interact with a huge amount of information. But what 
you may not know is that humans have been using 
social interaction tools for over two thousand years. 
This is what Tom Standage, author of the book Writing on the 
Wall - Social Media, The first 2 000 Years, claims.

According to Standage, Marcus Tullius Cicero, Roman philosopher and 
politician, would have been, along with other members of the 
Roman elite, a precursor in the use of social networks. The author 
recounts how Cicero used a slave, who later 
became his scribe, to write messages on scrolls 
of papyrus that were sent to a kind of network of 
contacts. These people, in turn, copied his text, 
added their own comments and passed it on. 'Today we have computers and broadband, but the 
Romans had slaves and scribes who transmitted their 
messages,' Standage told BBC Brazil. 'Members 
of the Roman elite wrote to each other constantly, 
commenting on the latest political movements and 
expressing opinions.'

In addition to papyrus, another platform commonly used 
by the Romans was a wax tablet the size and shape of a 
modern tablet, on which they wrote messages, 
questions or transmitted the main points of the acta 
diurna, a 'newspaper' displayed daily in the Forum of 
Rome. This tablet, the 'Ancient Rome iPad', was taken 
by a messenger to the recipient, who replied 
below the message.

forgot to take. About the stone corral
of peace and other sad cows
crying to the moon and the calfless night.
About the wide wall of this pond
where other green snakes slithered,
and putting the sun in their still eyes

set and unset: the Three Marys,

Another interpretation is made based on the social conditions of that time. For the nanny and for the child for whom the song was sung, the music spoke of marriage as a natural destiny in a woman's life, in Brazilian society of the 19th century, marked by patriarchy. The music prepares the girl for her destiny not only as inexorable, but desirable: marriage, establishing a hierarchy of obedience (father, older brother, husband), according to the time and circumstances of her life.

Three gentlemen came to help
All three with their hats in hand
The first was her father
The second, her brother
The third was the one
To whom Teresa gave her hand

For the nanny and for the child for whom the song was sung, the music spoke of marriage as a natural destiny in a woman's life, in the Brazilian society of the 19th century, marked by patriarchy. The music prepares the girl for her destiny not only inexorable, but desirable: marriage, establishing a hierarchy of obedience (father, older brother, husband), according to the time and circumstances of her life.

The Tupi language in Brazil

Three hundred years ago, living in the village of São Paulo de Piratininga (dried fish, in Tupi) was almost synonymous with speaking the language of the Indians. Out of every five inhabitants of the city, only two knew Portuguese. Therefore, in 1698, the governor of the province, Artur de Sá e Meneses, begged Portugal to only send priests who knew 'the general language of the Indians', because 'those people do not explain themselves in any other language'.

Derived from the dialect of São Vicente, the Tupi of São Paulo developed and spread in the 17th century, thanks to the geographical isolation of the city and the not-so-Christian activity of the Paulista mamelucos: the bandeiras, expeditions into the hinterland in search of Indian slaves. Many bandeirantes did not even speak Portuguese or expressed themselves poorly. Domingos Jorge Velho, the Paulista who destroyed the Quilombo dos Palmares in 1694, was described by the bishop of Pernambuco as 'a barbarian who doesn't even know how to speak'. In their wanderings, these people baptized places like Avanhandava (place where the Indian runs), Pindamonhangaba (place to make a fishing hook), and Itu (waterfall). And ended up inventing a new language.
'The slaves of the bandeirantes came from more than 100 different tribes,' says historian and anthropologist John Monteiro, from the State University of Campinas. 'This changed the Paulista Tupi, which, in addition to the influence of Portuguese, also received words from other languages.' The result of the mixture became known as the general language of the south, a kind of simplified Tupi.

That Caetano Veloso shone singing Alegria, alegria

The Ticuna language is the most spoken language among Brazilian indigenous people. According to researcher Aryon Rodrigues, there are 40 thousand Indians who speak the language. Most of them live along the Solimões River, in the Upper Amazon. It is the largest indigenous nation in Brazil, also found in Peru and Colombia. The Ticunas speak a language considered isolated, which does not resemble any other indigenous language and presents complexities in its phonology and syntax. Its main characteristic is the use of different pitches in the voice.

The intensive use of the language is not threatened by the proximity of cities or even by living with speakers of other languages within the Ticuna area: in the villages, these other speakers are in the minority and end up submitting to the Ticuna reality, which is why they may not represent a linguistic threat.

TEXT II

Wealth of language

“English is destined to be a world language in a broader sense than Latin was in the past era and French is in the present,” said American President John Adams in the 18th century. The prophecy has come true: English is now the lingua franca of globalization. At the opposite end of the global linguistic economy are the languages of declining small communities. It is estimated that today there are 6,000 to 7,000 languages spoken worldwide. Almost half of them are expected to disappear in the next 100 years. The last edition of Ethnologue — the most comprehensive study on world languages — from 2005 listed 516 languages at risk of extinction.

Wealth of language

“English is destined to be a world language in a broader sense than Latin was in the past era and French is in the present,” said American President John Adams in the 18th century. The prophecy has come true: English is now the lingua franca of globalization. At the opposite end of the global linguistic economy are the languages of declining small communities. It is estimated that today there are 6,000 to 7,000 languages spoken worldwide. Almost half of them are expected to disappear in the next 100 years. The last edition of Ethnologue — the most comprehensive study on world languages — from 2005 listed 516 languages at risk of extinction.

The Ticuna language is the most spoken language among Brazilian indigenous people. According to researcher Aryon Rodrigues, there are 40 thousand Indians who speak the language. Most of them live along the Solimões River, in the Upper Amazon. It is the largest indigenous nation in Brazil, also found in Peru and Colombia. The Ticunas speak a language considered isolated, which does not resemble any other indigenous language and presents complexities in its phonology and syntax. Its main characteristic is the use of different pitches in the voice.

The intensive use of the language is not threatened by the proximity of cities or even by living with speakers of other languages within the Ticuna area: in the villages, these other speakers are a minority and end up submitting to the Ticuna reality, which is perhaps why they do not represent a linguistic threat.

As atrizes

Naturally
She smiled
But didn't give me any attention
Changed clothes
In front of me
And went dancing without a care
She chose anyone
Threw glances
Right under my nose
Danced close
With new partners
With one foot back
With one foot ready
Others appeared
Naturally
Without even looking at me
Took a shower
In front of me
To go out with another guy
But I never cared
About such lovers
[...]
With so many movies
In my mind
It's natural that every actress
Currently represents

 Zé Araújo began to sing in a sad tone, telling 
to the curious who began to arrive that a woman 
had knelt at the feet of the holy cross and sworn 
in the name of Jesus a great love, but swore and did not fulfill, 
pretended and deceived me, you lied to me, 
you sinned against God, the heart has reasons that reason itself 
does not know, makes promises and vows, then forgets.

  The caboclo was sad and inspired. After this 
song that gave Neusa goosebumps, he followed with 
a even more spirited waltz, full of difficult words, 
but beautiful as only a serene drop. It was the story of a 
charming doll seen in a crystal showcase on the 
majestic pedestal. Zé Araújo closed his eyes and let 
out his voice:

Her hair had the color/ Of the sun radiating/ 
Fulvous rays of love./ Her eyes were circunvagos/
Of the blue romanticism of lakes/ Lyrical hands, divine arms,/ 
An unmatched white body/ And very small feet./ Finally I saw in this doll/ A perfect 
Venus.

to the curious who began to arrive that a woman 
had knelt at the feet of the holy cross and sworn in 
the name of Jesus a great love, but swore and did not fulfill, 
pretended and deceived me, you lied to me, you sinned against God, the heart has reasons that reason itself 
does not know, makes promises and vows, then forgets.

Her hair had the color/ Of the sun radiating/ 
Fulvous rays of love./ Her eyes were circunvagos/
Of the blue romanticism of lakes/ Lyrical hands, divine arms,/

In participation sport or popular sport, the manifestation occurs in the principle of ludic pleasure, which aims at the social well-being of its practitioners. It is closely associated with leisure and free time and occurs in spaces not committed to time and outside the obligations of daily life.

Around three in the afternoon

In this room crowded with tables, machines and papers, where enviable clerks shared among themselves the common sense of the world, applying themselves to clear ideas despite the noise and the mugginess, confident as they spoke about problems that afflict modern man (a species from which you, millennia tired, may feel somewhat excluded), suddenly drop everything under the gazes around you, compose a face of quiet and dangerous madness, make gestures as calm as the most severe scribes, give a wide 'ciao' to the day's work, as if bidding farewell to life, and surprise a little later, with your presence at such an unusual hour, those who were at home busy cleaning the closets, which you did not know before how it was done. It is advisable not to respond to the inquisitive looks, letting the intense expectation that sets in grow for a moment. But do not overdo it and quickly go up to the room, freeing your feet from socks and shoes, taking off your clothes as if removing the importance of things, finally putting on minimal clothing, perhaps even bare, but without offending decorum (your decorum, of course), and accepting at the same time, as a good provisional truth, any change in behavior.

From the village of Ão, or from the nearby sites, someone urgently needed to want to come to listen to the radio soap opera. He listened to it, learned it, kept it in mind, and, returning to Ão, the next day, he repeated it to others.
That's how they were having dinner, the people from the village came to receive the new part of the radio soap opera. They had already heard everything at once, it was out of the ordinary: the truck of a chicken and egg buyer, Mr. Abrãozinho Buristém, had failed there in Ão the day before, carrying a small battery-powered radio, had set up a wire on the wire fence... But they wanted to listen again, for confirmation. - ""The story is stable and good, even though it's long: it's repetitive..."" - Zuz explained to Dalberto.

The pessimist
Gabriel García Márquez
Gerineldo sleeps because he is already resigned to his world. Because he already knows everything that can happen to him after subjecting all the objects around him to a meticulous inventory of possibilities.

Better than anyone, Gerineldo knows the coefficient of expansion of his windows and keeps marked on the thermometer, with a red line, the point at which the glass will break, shattered into shards of death.
