On July 1st, 2012, the city of Rio de Janeiro 
became the first in the world to receive the title of 
UNESCO World Heritage as a Cultural Landscape. 
The application, submitted by the National Institute of 
Historical and Artistic Heritage (Iphan), was approved 
during the 36th Session of the World Heritage Committee. 
The president of Iphan explained that 'the carioca landscape 
is the most explicit image of what we can call

Some time ago I realized that, since my early years, I had received many false opinions as true, and that what I later founded on such poorly secured principles could only be very doubtful and uncertain. It was necessary to seriously try, once in my life, to get rid of all the opinions to which I had previously given credit, and start all over again in order to establish a firm and unshakable knowledge.

It is the radical character of what is sought that demands the radicalization of the search process itself.

the traveler has the relief of a wide horizon and the

TEXT I

Our fight is for the democratization of land ownership, 
increasingly concentrated in our country. 
About 1% of all landowners control 46% 
of the lands. We exert pressure through the occupation of 
unproductive large estates and properties that do not 
fulfill their social function, as determined by the Constitution 
of 1988. We also occupy farms that have their origin 
in the land grabbing of public lands.

TEXT II

The small rural landowner is like a small 
shop owner: the smaller the business, the harder 
it is to maintain, as it has to be productive and the burdens are 
hard to bear. I am in favor of productive and 
sustainable properties that generate jobs. Supporting a 
productive company that generates jobs is much cheaper and generates 
much more than supporting agrarian reform.

No one is unaware of the need that all 
farmers have to increase the number of their 
workers. And how did farmers supply the necessary 
arms until recently? Farms were fueled by the acquisition of slaves, without the slightest 
financial aid from the government. Now, if farmers supplied arms at their own expense, and if it is still possible to obtain them, albeit of a different quality, why should they not seek to achieve them in the same way, that is, at their own expense?

Artificial muscles are devices made with smart plastics that respond to an electric current with a mechanical movement. The oxidation and reduction of a conductive polymer create positive and/or negative charges in the material, which are compensated by the insertion or expulsion of cations or anions. For example, in the figure, the dark films are made of polypyrrole and the white film is made of a polymeric electrolyte containing an inorganic salt. When polypyrrole undergoes oxidation, anions are inserted to compensate for the positive charge in the polymer and the film expands. On the other side of the device, the polypyrrole film undergoes reduction, expelling anions, and the film contracts. Through sandwich assembly, the entire system moves harmonically, as shown in the figure.

in 1910, in Rio de Janeiro; therefore, if he were alive,
he would be turning 100 years old. But he died at 26 years
of age, victim of tuberculosis, leaving a collection of

The hypertext refers to non-sequential and non-linear electronic writing, which branches out and allows the reader to access a practically unlimited number of other texts through local and successive choices, in real time. Thus, the reader is able to interactively define the flow of their reading based on subjects addressed in the text without being tied to a fixed sequence or topics established by an author. It is a form of textual structuring that makes the reader simultaneously a co-author of the final text. The hypertext is characterized as a multilinear, multisequential, and undetermined electronic writing/reading process, carried out in a new writing space. Thus, by allowing various levels of treatment of a theme, the hypertext offers the possibility of multiple degrees of depth simultaneously, since it does not have a defined sequence, but links texts that are not necessarily correlated.

In the caprice

Little Adam, my buddy, while waiting for the sheriff, looked at a painting of a lady. When the authority entered and noticed that the countryman admired such figure, he asked: 'What do you think? Do you like this painting?' 

And Little Adam, with all the sincerity that God gives to the countryman: 'But for God's sake, sir! What an ugly woman! She looks like a scarecrow, a relative of the devil, uglier than a blind fight in the dark.' 

To which the sheriff had no choice but to confess, a little dryly: 'It's my mother.' And the countryman, on top of the situation, doesn't lose his cool: 'Well, sir, it's a well-crafted ugliness.'

Road

This road where I live, between two turns of the road,

It is more interesting than an urban avenue.

In cities all people look alike.

Everyone is equal. Everyone is everybody.

Not here: it feels good that everyone brings their soul.

Each creature is unique.

Even the dogs.
These country dogs look like businessmen:
They are always worried.
And how many people come and go!
And everything has that impressive character that makes you meditate:
Burial on foot or a milk cart pulled by a sly little goat.
Not even the murmur of the water is missing, to suggest, through the voice of symbols,
That life goes by! that life goes by!
And that youth will end.

It's water that never ends

Preliminary data released by researchers from the Federal University of Pará (UFPA) pointed out the Alter do Chão Aquifer as the largest deposit of potable water on the planet. With an estimated volume of 86,000 cubic kilometers of fresh water, the underground reserve is located under the states of Amazonas, Pará, and Amapá. 'This amount of water would be enough to supply the world's population for 500 years,' says Milton Matta, a geologist from UFPA.
In comparative terms, Alter do Chão has almost twice the volume of water from the Guarani Aquifer (with 45,000 cubic kilometers). Until then, Guarani was the largest underground reserve in the world, distributed among Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay.

When the Portuguese settled in Brazil,
the country was populated by Indians. They later imported
a large number of slaves from Africa. The Portuguese, the
Indian, and the Black constitute, during the colonial period,
the three bases of the Brazilian population. But in terms of culture, the Portuguese contribution was by far
the most noted.

For a long time, Portuguese and Tupi lived
side by side as communication languages. It was Tupi
that the bandeirantes used in their expeditions.
In 1694, Father Antônio Vieira said that 'the families
of the Portuguese and Indians in São Paulo are so
connected today, that women and children are raised mystically and domestically, and the language spoken
in these families is that of the Indians, and the Portuguese
language is what the children go to school to learn.'

Abated by the harmonious and nostalgic fado of the exiles, everyone was going, even the Brazilians, concentrating and falling into sadness; but suddenly, Porfiro's cavaquinho, accompanied by Firmo's guitar, vibrantly broke out with a weeping Bahian. Nothing more than the first chords of the creole music for the blood of all those people to awaken soon, as if someone were lashing their body with stinging nettles. And other notes followed, and others, increasingly ardent and more delirious.

Save 

To save something is not to hide it or lock it up.
In a safe, nothing is saved.
In a safe, the thing is lost from sight.
To save something is to look at it, gaze at it, admire it in order to illuminate it or be illuminated by it.
To save something is to watch over it, that is, to keep vigil for it, that is, to guard it, that is, to be awake for it, that is, to be for it or be by it.
That's why the flight of a bird is better saved
Than a bird without flights.
That's why a poem is written, that's why it is said, that's why it is published,
that's why a poem is declared and recited:
To save it:
So that it, in turn, saves what it saves:
Save whatever a poem saves:
That's why the throw of the poem:
To save what you want to save.

The history of the Sapucaí tribe, which translated into the Guarani language the artifacts of the computer era that gained importance in their lives, such as mouse (which they call angojhá) and windows (oventã)

When the internet reached that community, which houses around 400 Guaranis, four years ago, through a project by the Committee for Democratization of Informatics (CDI), in partnership with the NGO Rede Povos da Floresta and with an antenna provided by Star One (from Embratel), Potty and his village soon envisioned the communication possibilities that the web brings.

He says they currently use the network only for preparing and sending documents, but they realized that it can help preserve indigenous culture.

The appropriation of the network happened gradually, but the Guaranis have already incorporated the technological novelty into their lifestyle. The importance of the internet and computing for them is expressed in a rare case of incorporation: that of vocabulary.

— One day, the chief of the Sapucaí village called me. “We don't want to call a computer a ‘computer’. I suggested they create a word in Guarani. And they created aiú irú rive, ‘box to accumulate language’.

There are certain established uses in speech, and even 
in writing, which, depending on the social stratum and the 
level of education of the speaker, are undoubtedly predictable. 
They even occur in speakers who master the standard variety, 
because they actually reveal tendencies existing in the language 
in its process of change that cannot be blocked in the name of a 'linguistic ideal' represented by the rules of 
prescriptive grammar. Uses such as using 'ter' instead of 'haver' in existential constructions (tem muitos livros na estante), 
the use of the object pronoun in the subject position (para mim fazer o trabalho), the lack of agreement in passive sentences with 'se' (aluga-se casas) are indications of the existence, not of a single norm, but of a plurality of norms, understood, once again, as a set of linguistic habits, without implying a value judgment.

Motivated or not historically, norms prestigious 
or stigmatized by the community overlap throughout 
the territory, whether in a relationship of opposition or complementarity, without, however, canceling out the intersection of 
uses that shape a national norm distinct from that of 
European Portuguese. By focusing on this issue, which opposes 
not only the norms of Portuguese from Portugal to the norms of 
Brazilian Portuguese, but also the so-called 
local educated norms to the popular or vernacular ones, one must insist 
on the idea that these norms have been consolidated at 
different moments in our history and that only from the

Twitter's success in Brazil is a unique opportunity to understand the importance of conciseness in writing genres

The maxim 'less is more' has never made as much sense as in the case of the microblog Twitter, whose premise is to say something — no matter what — in 140 characters. Since the service was created in 2006, the number of users of the tool has been increasing, as well as the diversity of its use. From the 'dear diary' style to concise literature, through aphorisms, quotes, journalism, gossip, humor, etc., everything fits into a tweet ('chirp' in English), and understanding its success can indicate a path to the improvement of a vital writing resource: conciseness.

It is possible to use water or food to attract birds and observe them. Many people usually use sugar water, for example, to attract hummingbirds. But it is important to know that, when making the mixture, you should always use one part of sugar to five parts of water. In addition, on hot days, you need to change the water two to three times, as it can ferment with the heat and, if ingested by the bird, can make it sick. Excess sugar, when crystallized, can also keep the bird's beak closed, preventing it from feeding. This can even kill it.

indicates the color of our forests. The yellow rhombus indicates the color of the natural riches 
that our dear Brazil holds like the 
gold. In the center of the flag, there is a blue sphere that indicates the 
earth, and the stars inside the sphere represent 
the states. In the band inside the sphere is written the motto 
Order and Progress, which represents the basis of the republic and the 
organization of the Brazilian people. Hail! Brazilian Flag

Secret Evil

If the anger that foams, the pain that dwells
In the soul, and destroys every illusion that arises,
Everything that stings, everything that devours
The heart, were stamped on the face;
If one could, the spirit that cries,
See through the mask of the face,
How many people, perhaps, who now envy
Would then cause us pity!
How many people who laugh, perhaps, to themselves
Keep a fierce, hidden enemy,
Like an invisible cancerous sore!
How many people who laugh, perhaps exist,
Whose only happiness consists
In appearing happy to others!

New technologies

Currently, there is a prevailing discourse in the media about the exaltation of new technologies, especially those related to telecommunications. Common expressions such as 'the future has already arrived', 'technological wonders' and 'total connection with the world' 'fetishize' new products, turning them into objects of desire, of mandatory consumption. For this reason, today we carry in our pockets, bags, and backpacks the so much celebrated 'future'. However, we cannot reduce ourselves to mere victims of a perverse media device, or of a controlling capitalist device. There is perversion, certainly, and control, without a doubt. Nevertheless, we have developed a symbiotic relationship of mutual dependence with the media vehicles, which tightens with each shared image and with each personal dossier transformed into a public object of entertainment.

No longer like those chained in Plato's cave, we are free to imprison ourselves, by spontaneous will, in this sadomasochistic relationship with the media structures, in which we both control and are controlled.

Play fair

Arguing is not winning a discussion at any cost. Convincing someone of something is, first and foremost, an alternative to the practice of winning an issue by shouting or physical violence - or non-physical. Non-physical, colon. A politician who blatantly lies can captivate voters. An advertisement that plays dirty can embarrass crowds into consuming a product harmful to the environment. There are psychological manipulations not only in religion. And it is common for people to act emotionally, because they are victims of cunning - and backstabbing - seduction. Although effectiveness at all costs is not arguing, nor is it about admitting only scientific truths - forming an opinion only after seeing the demonstration and evidence, as science does. Arguing is a matter of everyday life, a form of rhetoric, but it is a reasoning that tries to convince without becoming mere manipulative calculation, and it can be rigorous without being scientific.

Everything in the world began with a yes. One molecule 
said yes to another molecule and life was born. But before 
prehistoric times there was the prehistory of prehistory and there was the 
never and there was the yes. There always was. I don't know what, but 
I know that the universe never began.

[...]
As long as I have questions and there are no answers 
I will continue to write. How to start at the beginning, if things 
happen before they happen? If before the pre-
prehistoric times there were already apocalyptic monsters? If this 
story does not exist, it will come to exist. To think is an act. 
To feel is a fact. Both together — it's me who writes what I'm writing. [...] Happiness? I've never seen a crazier word, invented by the northeastern women who walk around 
in droves.

As I will say now, this story will be the result 
of a gradual vision — for two and a half years I have been slowly discovering the whys. It's a vision of imminence of. 
Of what? Who knows if later I will know. As if 
I am writing at the very moment I am being read. I just don't 
start with the end that would justify the beginning — as death 
seems to say about life — because I need to record the 
preceding facts.

It is evident that vitamin D is important — but how to get it? Really, vitamin D can be naturally produced by exposure to sunlight, but it also exists in some common foods. However, as a source of this vitamin, certain foods are better than others. Some have a significant amount of vitamin D naturally, and are foods that you may not want to overdo: butter, cream, egg yolk, and liver.

We all know that vitamin D (cholecalciferol) is crucial for your health. But is vitamin D really a vitamin? Is it present in the foods that humans normally consume?

The bit in the Gutenberg galaxy

In this century, writing shares ground with various means of communication. This question makes us think about the need for the 'interweaving, coexistence, and reciprocal interpretation of the various circuits of knowledge production and dissemination...'

It is necessary to relativize our stance towards modern technologies, especially computing. It is an innovative field, no doubt, but its foundations are in previous informative models, including, in the oral tradition and in the natural ability to mentally simulate events in the world and anticipate the consequences of our actions. Printing is the matrix that triggered this entire electronic communication process. I emphasize, therefore, the kinship between the computer and other means of communication, especially writing, a view of computing as a 'development of what printed literary production and, previously, the oral tradition already carried within them.'

Blanket that sews tales and stories within 
a family serves as a metaphor for memory in a work 
written by a Portuguese author

What could be worth more than the blanket 
for that family? Famous painters' paintings? Queen's jewels? Palaces? A blanket made of hundreds of 
scraps of old clothes warmed the children's feet 
and the grandmother's memory, who with each square pointed out by 
her grandchildren rescued a story from her memories. 
Fantastical stories like the one of the dress with a pocket 
that housed a cookie-eating gnome; mischievous stories like the shorts 
transformed into rags on the day the boy, who liked to ride 
his bike with his eyes closed, broke his arm; stories 
of longing, like the apron that carried a letter 
for over a month... Many stories formed that 
blanket. The protagonists were family members, an uncle, 
aunt, grandfather, great-grandmother, herself, the former owners 
of the clothes. One day, the grandmother died, and the aunts started 
to dispute the blanket, they all wanted it, more than the 
paintings, jewels, and palaces left by her. Fortunately, the aunts managed to reach an agreement, and the blanket started 
to spend each month at one of their houses. And the scraps, 
as they ran out, were replaced by 
other scraps, and new and old stories were being 
incorporated into the most valuable blanket in the world.

Football: “Rebellion is what changes the world”
Get to know the story of Afonsinho, the first 

Brazilian football player to defeat the football bureaucracy and 

achieve the Free Pass, exactly 40 years ago

Pelé was retiring for real for the first time,  then  wearing  Santos'  jersey  (because  later 
he would play for New York Cosmos, from the United States), in 1972, when he was asked if, finally, 
he felt like a free man. The King replied without hesitation:
—  The only free man in football that I know is Afonsinho. He is the one who can say, using his own words, 
that he shouted independence or death. No one else. The rest is just talk.

Although  his  statements  were  mocked  by  the  football  media  and  even  by  the  Brazilian 
supporters, the Athlete of the Century was right. 
And he would probably be right again today.

Out of admiration for one of his club colleagues 
of that year. Out of 
recognition of the character and 
personality of one of the most controversial players 
in Brazilian football. And mainly because of the story 
of struggle — and victory — of Afonsinho over the football bureaucrats.

Sick, I think between sneezes about how the word 
flu came to us after a series of contagions among 
languages. The epidemic of flu 
that spread throughout Europe started in Italy in 1743, in addition to the virus itself, two viral words: the Italian influenza and the French 
flu. The first was a term derived from medieval Latin 
influentia, which meant “influence of the stars 
on men”. The second was just the nominal form 
of the verb gripper, that is, “to grab”. It is assumed that it referred to the violent way the virus takes hold of the infected organism.

Chapter LIV - The pendulum

I left there savoring the kiss. I couldn't sleep; I lay in bed, that's for sure, but it was the same as nothing. I heard
all the hours of the night. Usually, when I lost sleep, the ticking of the pendulum made me very ill; that somber, slow, and dry tick-tock seemed to say with each stroke that I was going to have one less moment of life. I then imagined an old devil, sitting between two bags, one of life and one of death, and counting them like this:

- Another one less...
- Another one less...
- Another one less...
- Another one less...
The most peculiar thing is that, if the clock stopped, I would wind it up so that it would never stop ticking, and I could count all my lost moments. There are inventions that change or end; the same institutions die; the clock is definitive and perpetual. The last man, bidding farewell to the cold and worn-out sun, must have a clock in his pocket, to know the exact time of his death.
That night I did not suffer from that sad feeling of boredom, but another, and delightful. Fantasies tumultuated inside me, they came one after the other, like devotees jostling to see the angel-singer of processions. I did not hear the lost moments, but the gained minutes.

For Carr, the internet acts in the commerce of distraction

Author of 'The Shallows' analyzes the influence

of technology on the mind

American journalist Nicholas Carr believes that the
internet does not stimulate anyone's intelligence. The author
explains scientific discoveries about the functioning of the
human brain and theorizes about the influence of the internet
on our way of thinking.

For him, the network makes the reasoning of those who navigate
more shallow, in addition to fragmenting the attention of its users.
Moreover: Carr asserts that there are companies profiting
from the recent fragility of our attention. 'The more
time we spend online and the faster we move from one
information to another, the more money
internet companies make,' he evaluates.

'These companies are in the commerce of distraction and
are experts in keeping us increasingly hungry for
information fragmented into small parts. It is clear
that they have an interest in stimulating us and taking advantage
of our compulsion for technology.'

In fact, what is commonly called Indians 
is a group of more than three hundred peoples who, together, speak 
more than 180 different languages. Each of these peoples 
has different histories, legends, traditions, concepts 
and views on life, freedom, time 
and nature. In common, these communities 
present a deep communion with the environment in which they live, respect for older individuals, concern for future generations, and the sense that 
individual happiness depends on the success of the group. For 
them, success is the result of a collective construction. 
These ideas, shared by indigenous peoples, are 
esential to build any modern notion of 
civilization. The true representatives of backwardness in our country are not the Indians, but those who are guided by prejudiced and outdated views of 'progress'.

What is virtual bullying or cyberbullying?

It is the bullying that occurs in electronic means, with defamatory or threatening messages circulating through emails, websites, blogs (virtual diaries), social networks and cell phones. It is almost an extension of what they say and do at school, but with the aggravating factor that the people involved are not face to face.

In this way, anonymity can increase the cruelty of comments and threats and the effects can be as serious or worse.

Girl: s.f., fem. of boy: young woman; girl; young girl;

I write a poem about the girl who is sitting
in the cafe, in front of the coffee cup, while 
combing her hair with her hand. But I can't write this 
poem about that girl because, in Brazil, the word 
girl does not mean what it says in Portugal. So, 
I will have to write about the young woman in the cafe, the young woman in the cafe, 
the girl in the cafe, so that the reputation of the poor girl 
who combs her hair with her hand, in a cafe in Lisbon, is not 
ruined forever when this poem crosses the 
Atlantic to disembark in Rio de Janeiro. And all this 
without thinking about Africa, because there I will 
have to write about the girl from the cafe, to 
avoid the too continental tone of the girl, which is 
a word that is already giving me headaches 
because, in the end, the only thing I wanted 
was to write a poem about the girl in the 
cafe. The solution, then, is to change cafes, and limit myself to 
writing a poem about that cafe where no 
girl can sit at the table because they only serve coffee at the counter.

Manchester after the Industrial Revolution. It is the 
too much accumulation of carbon dioxide and sulfur

layer, form drops of acid rain and aerosol particles. Acid rain 
does not necessarily occur at the polluting site, as such pollutants, when 
released into the atmosphere, are carried by the winds, 
can cause the reaction in distant regions. 
Pure water has a pH of 7, and, when in contact with

The main reason why capitalism as a system is so terribly destructive of the biosphere is that, in most cases, the producers who profit from the destruction do not account for it as a production cost, but rather, precisely the opposite, as a cost reduction. For example, if a producer dumps garbage into a river, polluting its waters, this producer considers that they are saving the cost of other safer, but more expensive, methods of waste disposal.

Astronomical observations indicate that at the center 
of our galaxy, the Milky Way, there is probably a 
black hole whose mass is thousands of times the 
mass of the Sun. A simple technique to estimate the mass 
of this black hole consists of observing an object 
orbiting around it and measuring the period of a complete rotation, T, as well as the average radius, R, of the object's orbit, 
which supposedly moves, with good approximation, in 
uniform circular motion. In this situation, consider 
that the resultant force, due to the circular motion, is 
equal, in magnitude, to the gravitational force that the black hole exerts on the object.

Laser hair removal (popularly known as laser hair removal) consists of the application of a light source to heat and cause a localized and controlled injury to the hair follicles. To prevent other tissues from being damaged, wavelengths are selected that are absorbed by the melanin present in the hair, but do not affect the oxy-hemoglobin of the blood and the water in the tissues of the region where the treatment will be applied. The figure shows how different wavelengths are absorbed by melanin, oxy-hemoglobin, and water.

At the first refueling stop, a car from this team showed a record on its onboard computer indicating the consumption of four tenths of the gasoline originally in the tank. To minimize the weight of this car and ensure the end of the race, the support team refueled the car with one third of what was left in the tank upon arrival at the refueling station.

approximately 300 m² of panels will be installed, with 100 m² for generating electrical energy used on the

A healthy group relationship requires a number of individuals working interdependently to complete a project, with total individual participation and personal contribution. If one person dominates, the other members have little growth or pleasure in the activity, there is no true relationship in the group. Theater is an artistic activity that requires the talent and energy of many people - from the first idea of a play or scene to the last echo of applause. Without this interaction there is no place for the individual actor, because without the functioning of the group, who would he represent, what materials would he use and what effects could he produce? The student-actor must learn that 'how to act', just like in the game, is intrinsically linked to all other people in the complexity of the art form. Improvisational theater requires a very intense group relationship, as it is from agreement and group performance that the material for scenes and plays emerges.

of the workspace. Currently, organizations 
are focusing on new values, such as innovations, 
satisfaction, responsibilities, results, and a 
familiar work environment. The alternative of telecommuting 
complements these principles and offers flexibility 
to employers and employees. It is a new concept that, 
every day, gains more strength around the world. Large 
companies have chosen telecommuting work for the 
facilities it provides to the employer. The implementation 
of telecommuting sets rules for working 
at home on specific days of the week and, on the other 
days, working in the office. The workplace can 
be the home or, temporarily, for travel reasons, 
other offices.

Lose the tramontana

The ideal expression to talk about disoriented and other

words of losing one's mind

Is to lose the north, to get disoriented. Literally,
“losing the tramontana” means losing sight of the
polar star, in Italian stella tramontana, located on the other side
of the mountains, which guided ancient sailors on their
pioneering journeys.
Losing sight of the

tramontana was synonymous with
disorientation. Yes, because, for them, the starry sky was
more valuable than the land. The South was an unknown,
unforeseen region; whereas the North had as a reference in the firmament
a luminous point known as the Polar Star, a
kind of lighthouse for the navigators of the Mediterranean,
especially the Genoese and the Venetians. In their language,
it was beyond the mountains, the Alps. Losing sight of it was losing the tramontana, losing
the North.

In today's world, subject to so many pressures, many
people cannot resist them and go crazy. Besides
losing their temper, they lose the tramontana...

Connect
  Establish relationships with
  people around you. The
  relationships are the basis

of daily life and investing time in them
will enrich your day and ensure support
when needed. Research shows
that those with fewer than three people
in their close contact network — between
family and friends — are more likely to
develop a mental illness.

Be active

      Walk or run, ride a
      bike, practice a sport,
                    dance. Exercise makes
people feel good — the important thing is
each person finding the activity that gives
them pleasure and that is suitable for their limits.
Long-term studies suggest that
engaging in physical activity prevents
decline in mental abilities and
protects against anxiety and depression.

Pay attention
   Be curious, savor
   life's moments and
   be aware of how you feel.

Reflecting on your experiences helps
you discover what really matters and
ensure that you live in the present. A
study showed that people trained
to pay attention to their feelings
for eight to 12 weeks showed
improvements in well-being for years.

Keep learning
Try something new, enroll in a course, take on
      a new task at work. Try

fixing something at home. Learn to play
an instrument or cook. Choose a
challenge that you will enjoy pursuing.
Studies suggest that well-being is
linked to having goals — as long as they are
established by individuals themselves and
are related to their personal values.

Give yourself
Thank someone, help a
                    friend or a stranger. Smile,
                    volunteer, join the neighborhood association. Look outside,
besides looking within yourself. Being part
of a community brings benefits — including
more meaningful social relationships.
Research shows that people
who have a greater interest in others
tend to consider themselves happier.

There's no point in isolating the smoker

If you really want to combat smoking, the government needs to go beyond restrictions. It is necessary to support those who want to quit smoking.

By supporting a provisional measure to combat smoking in public places in all 27 Brazilian states, the Senate reaffirmed a fundamental value: the defense of health and life.

In at least one aspect, MP 540/2011 is even stricter than the measures in force in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Paraná, states that have so far adopted the toughest anti-smoking laws. It prohibits smoking areas in 100% of enclosed spaces, including even tobacco shops, where smoking was allowed under certain conditions.

One of the main measures affects the smoker's pocket. The government is authorized to set a new price for a pack of cigarettes. The Excise Tax will be increased by 300%. Adding one thing and another, the taste of smoking will become much more bitter. It should rise by 20% in 2012 and 55% in 2013.

The fundamental vision of the MP is correct. It has long been known that tobacco is harmful to health. It is reasonable, therefore, for the State to act in the name of public health.

In 1866, having completed his studies at the School of Fine Arts in Paris, Pedro Américo offered the painting A Carioca to Emperor Pedro II, in recognition of his patron. The female nude obeyed the canons of great art and intended to be a feminine allegory of nationality. However, the painting was rejected as immoral and licentious: even though it did not escape the 19th-century rule regarding nudity in artwork, A Carioca could not, therefore, be immediately absorbed. The tangible sensuality of the female figure, close to the orientalism so in vogue in Europe, confronted not only moral limits but also the aesthetic and cultural orientation of the Empire. What was more shocking: the frontal nudity or a nude so detached from what was desired as acceptable national nudity, for example, that of romantic indigenous figures? A Carioca offered a body simultaneously ideal and obscene: the high - an immaterial beauty - and the low - an excessive carnality. It suggested a mixture of styles that, without breaking the rule of artistic decorum, insinuated on the canvas something unsuitable for the official symbolic repertoire. Could the exotic brunette, who is not indigenous - nor mulatto or black - represent a Brazilian feminine visuality and enjoy a prominent place in the imagery of our 'tropical monarchy'?

Vei, the Sun

Now the bird needed to relieve itself, it did 
and the hero ended up covered in vulture dirt. It was 
early dawn and the weather was completely cold. 
Macunaíma woke up trembling, all messy. Even so, he carefully examined the small stone of the islet to see 
if there was any hole with buried money. There wasn't. Not even the enchanted silver chain that 
points to the chosen one, Dutch treasure. There were only the little red jacutinga ants.

Then Caiuanogue passed by, the morning star. 
Macunaíma, already a little sick of living, asked her 
to take him to the sky.

Caiuanogue approached but the hero smelled really bad. 
— Go take a bath! — she said. And she left. 
That's how the expression “Go take a bath” was born, 
which Brazilians use to refer to certain European immigrants.

First of all, I would like to express my gratitude for the honor of coming back to Galicia and talking not only with former colleagues, some of whom are part of the board, but also with new colleagues, who belong to the new generation, in whose hands, for sure, lies the destiny of Galician in Galicia, and mainly the destiny of Galician incorporated into the great Lusophone family.

I chose as a theme how the founders of the Brazilian Academy of Letters saw the Portuguese language in their time. As you know, our Academy, founded in 1897, is now completing 110 years, it was organized by a meeting of journalists, literati, poets who met at the headquarters of the Brazilian Magazine, directed by a literary critic and a literati named José Veríssimo, a native of Pará, and from this enthusiasm came the idea of creating the Brazilian Academy, later annexed to its title: Brazilian Academy of Letters.

In this sense, Machado de Assis, who was the first president from its inauguration until the date of his death in 1908, imagined that our Academy should be a Literary Academy, therefore, of literati.

Linguistic change

Ataliba de Castilho, a Portuguese language professor at USP, explains that internet language is part of the natural metamorphosis of the language.

- With the internet, language follows the path of change phenomena, such as what happened with 'você', which became the clitic pronoun 'cê'. Now, internet users can help reduce spelling excesses, and we know there are many. Why is the accent mark so important for writing? We have had in Brazil moments even more exacerbated by accents and we have dispensed with many of them. As every word is contextualized by the speaker, we can dispense with many others. Internet users show a path, as they make a curious marriage between orality and scripturality. Internet language may, in the future, even make communication more efficient. Or evolve into a complex jargon, which, instead of bringing people closer in less time, encourages the isolation of the initiated and the exclusion of the laymen.

For Castilho, however, it will not be a spelling reform that will make the change we need in the language. It will be the internet. The way is to chat and wait to see?

Beyond the Information Revolution

The impact of the Information Revolution is just beginning. But the driving force behind this impact is not informatics, artificial intelligence, the effect of computers on decision-making or the development of policies or strategies. It is something that practically no one predicted, not even talked about 10 or 15 years ago: electronic commerce — the explosive emergence of the internet as an important, perhaps main, channel for worldwide distribution of products, services and, surprisingly, managerial-level jobs. This new reality is profoundly changing economies, markets and sectoral structures, products and services and their flow, segmentation, values and consumer behavior, the labor market.

The impact, however, may be even greater on societies and business policies and, above all, on how we view the world and ourselves within it. The psychological impact of the Information Revolution, like that of the Industrial Revolution, was enormous. Perhaps it was stronger in the way children learn. By the age of 4 (and sometimes even earlier), children develop computing skills, soon surpassing their parents. Computers are their toys and learning tools. In 50 years, we may conclude that there was no educational crisis in the world — only a growing incongruity between the way schools of the 20th century taught and the way children of the late 20th century learned.

Who does not remember Aurélia Camargo, who crossed the firmament of the court like a brilliant meteor, and suddenly disappeared in the midst of the dazzle she had produced? She was eighteen years old when she first appeared in society. They did not know her; and soon everyone eagerly sought information about the great novelty of the day. Much was said that I will not repeat now, for in due time we will know the truth, without the malevolent comments that the gossipmongers use to dress her up. Aurélia was an orphan; she had an old relative in her company, a widow, D. Firmina Mascarenhas, who always accompanied her in society. But this relative was nothing more than a guardian, to comply with the scruples of Brazilian society, which at that time had not yet admitted a certain female emancipation. While showing the proper deference to the widow's age, the girl did not deviate for a moment from her firm purpose of governing her house and directing her actions as she saw fit. It was also rumored that Aurélia had a tutor; but this entity was unknown, judging by the character of the pupil, it should not have exerted greater influence on her will than the old relative.

The Christmas turkey

Our first family Christmas, after the death of my father five months earlier, was of decisive consequences for family happiness. We had always been happy as a family, in that very abstract sense of happiness: honest people, without crimes, a home without internal fights or serious economic difficulties. But, mainly due to the gray nature of my father, devoid of any lyricism, of an incapable exemplarity, cushioned in mediocrity, we had always lacked that enjoyment of life, that taste for material happiness, a good wine, a spa season, acquiring a refrigerator, things like that. My father was a good wrong, almost dramatic, the pure-blood of joy-killers.

Love verses

To an erotic poet
Ideal opposite to my ideal you keep.
Different is, therefore, the other point of view
According to which, I observe love, from the selfish
Way of seeing, according to which, you observe it.
Because love, as I am loving it,
Is Spirit, is ether, is fluid substance,
It is like the air that one catches and takes care of,
Take care, however, not to be catching it!
It is the transubstantiation of rude instincts,
Imponderable, and impalpable,
That walks above the miserable flesh
As the heron walks above the ponds!

Art of loving

If you want to feel the happiness of loving, forget your
soul.

The soul is what spoils love.
Only in God can it find satisfaction.
Not in another soul.
Only in God — or outside the world.
Souls are incommunicable.
Let your body understand with another body.
Because bodies understand each other, but souls do not.

The world of great technological innovations, medical research advances, and that has already witnessed the sending of men into space is the same place where 1 billion people go to sleep and wake up hungry. Malnutrition ranks first among the top 10 health risks and kills more than AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis combined. The equivalent of the populations of Europe and North America together are going to bed hungry. And a hungry future awaits the human race.

Rosa was weaving nets, and the products of her small industry were well known in the surroundings. The reputation of the tapuia had grown with the making of a tucum palm tree adorned with the Brazilian crown, a work of naive taste, which had earned her the admiration of the entire region and provoked the envy of the famous Ana Raimunda, from Óbidos, who had managed to amass a small fortune with that specialty, when the North American industry had rendered the routine looms of the Amazon inactive.

Tale from a certain east

Emilie, unlike my father, Dorner, and our neighbors, had not lived in the interior of the Amazon. She, like me, had never crossed the river. Manaus was her visible world. The other throbbed in her memory. Enchanted by a melodious, almost enchanted voice, Emilie marvels at the description of the vine that dispels envy, the mottled leaves of a tajá tree that reproduces a man's fortune, the recipes of healers who see in certain forest herbs the enigma of the most fearsome diseases, with infusions of blood-colored recommended to alleviate thirty-six pains of the human body. 'And there are herbs that cure nothing,' the washerwoman revealed, 'but they stir our minds. Just take a sip of the boiling liquid for a Christian to dream many different lives in a single night.' This account might be of dubious veracity for other people, but not for Emilie.

From shyness

Being a notorious shy person is a contradiction. The shy person is horrified to be noticed, let alone notorious. If he became notorious for being shy, then he has to explain himself. After all, what resounding shyness is this, that attracts so much attention? If he became notorious despite being shy, maybe he was fooling himself along with others and his shyness is just a stratagem to be noticed. So secret that not even he knows. It's like in the psychoanalytic paradox, only someone who thinks very highly of themselves seeks an analyst to treat an inferiority complex, because only he thinks that feeling inferior is a disease. 

[...]
The shy person tries to convince himself that he only has problems with crowds, but this is not an advantage. For the shy person, two people are a crowd. When he can't escape and finds himself in front of an audience, the shy person does not think of the audience members as individuals. He multiplies them by four, because each individual has two eyes and two ears. Four ways, therefore, to receive his blunders. There is no point in asking the audience to close their eyes, or cover one eye and one ear to cut the shy person's discomfort in half. Nothing works. The shy person, in short, is convinced that he is the center of the Universe, and that his embarrassment will still be remembered when the stars turn to dust.","

The Mayans developed a vigesimal numbering system that could represent any non-negative integer with only three symbols. A shell represented zero, a dot represented the number 1, and a horizontal bar represented the number 5. Up to the number 19, the Mayans represented the numbers as shown in Figure 1:

Numbers greater than 19 are written vertically, following powers of 20 in positional notation, as shown in Figure 2.
That is, the number in the first position is multiplied by 20^0 = 1, the number in the second position is multiplied by 20^1 = 20, and so on. The results obtained in each position are summed to obtain the number in the decimal system.

Creativity in advertising: theories and reflections

Abstract: This article addresses a primordial question in advertising: creativity. Despite being acclaimed by the creative departments of agencies, we must be aware that not every ad is, in fact, creative. Through a theoretical rescue, in which concepts are treated in the light of advertising, the aim is to establish an understanding of the themes. To elucidate such questions, a print campaign from the XXXX brand is analyzed. The reflections point out that creative advertising is essentially simple and presents a reinterpretation of everyday life.

Romans used social networks two thousand years ago, says book

When tweeting or commenting below the post of one of your 
several friends on Facebook, you probably feel 
privileged to live in a time in history when it is 
possible to immediately reach a vast network of 
contacts through a simple click on the 'send' button. 
You may also reflect on how past generations 
could live without social media, devoid 
of the ability to see and be seen, to receive, generate 
and interact with a huge amount of information. But what 
you may not know is that humans have been using 
social interaction tools for over two thousand years. 
This is what Tom Standage, author of the book Writing on the 
Wall - Social Media, The first 2 000 Years, claims.

According to Standage, Marcus Tullius Cicero, Roman philosopher and 
politician, would have been, along with other members of the 
Roman elite, a precursor in the use of social networks. The author 
recounts how Cicero used a slave, who later 
became his scribe, to write messages on scrolls 
of papyrus that were sent to a kind of network of 
contacts. These people, in turn, copied his text, 
added their own comments and passed it on. 'Today we have computers and broadband, but the 
Romans had slaves and scribes who transmitted their 
messages,' Standage told BBC Brazil. 'Members 
of the Roman elite constantly wrote to each other, 
commenting on the latest political movements and 
expressing opinions.'

In addition to papyrus, another platform commonly used 
by the Romans was a wax tablet the size and shape of a 
modern tablet, on which they wrote messages, 
questions or transmitted the main points of the acta
diurna, a 'newspaper' displayed daily in the Forum of 
Rome. This tablet, the 'Ancient Rome iPad', was taken 
by a messenger to the recipient, who replied 
below the message.

Texts and hypertexts: seeking balance
There is a fear on the part of parents and some teachers that children will unlearn when browsing, fear of them becoming addicted, of obtaining unreliable information, of isolating themselves from the real world, as if the computer were an agent of evil, a villain. This fear is reinforced by the media, which usually presents the computer as a negative agent in learning and in the socialization of users. We know that no one is at risk of unlearning when browsing, whether in digital environments or in printed materials, but it is necessary to see what is being learned and sometimes interfere in this process in order to optimize or guide learning, showing users other themes, other paths, other possibilities different from those they found on their own or those they usually use. It is necessary, sometimes, to negotiate the use so that it is not exclusive, since there are other means of communication, other means of information, and other leisure alternatives. It is a matter of balancing and not blaming.

Another interpretation is made based on the social conditions of that time. For the nanny and for the child for whom the song was sung, the music spoke of marriage as a natural destiny in a woman's life, in the Brazilian society of the 19th century, marked by patriarchy. The music prepares the girl for her destiny not only inexorable, but desirable: marriage, establishing a hierarchy of obedience (father, older brother, husband), according to the time and circumstances of her life.

The Tupi language in Brazil

300 years ago, living in the village of São Paulo de Piratininga (dried fish, in Tupi) was almost synonymous with speaking the Indian language. Out of every five inhabitants of the city, only two knew Portuguese. Therefore, in 1698, the governor of the province, Artur de Sá e Meneses, begged Portugal to only send priests who knew 'the general language of the Indians', because 'those people do not explain themselves in any other language'.

Derived from the dialect of São Vicente, the Tupi of São Paulo developed and spread in the 17th century, thanks to the geographical isolation of the city and the unchristian activity of the Paulista mamelucos: the bandeiras, expeditions to the backlands in search of Indian slaves. Many bandeirantes did not even speak Portuguese or expressed themselves poorly. Domingos Jorge Velho, the Paulista who destroyed the Quilombo dos Palmares in 1694, was described by the bishop of Pernambuco as 'a barbarian who doesn't even know how to speak'. In their wanderings, these people baptized places like Avanhandava (place where the Indian runs), Pindamonhangaba (place to make a fishing hook), and Itu (waterfall). And ended up inventing a new language.
'The slaves of the bandeirantes came from more than 100 different tribes,' says historian and anthropologist John Monteiro, from the State University of Campinas. 'This changed the Paulista Tupi, which, in addition to the influence of Portuguese, also received words from other languages.' The result of the mixture became known as the general language of the south, a kind of simplified Tupi.

Declaration of love

This is a confession of love: I love the Portuguese language. 
It is not easy. It is not malleable. [...] The Portuguese language is 
a real challenge for those who write. Especially for 
those who write, taking off the first layer of superficiality from things and people. 

Sometimes it reacts to a more complicated thought. Sometimes it is scared by the unpredictable 
of a sentence. I like to handle it - as I liked to be mounted on a horse and guide it by the reins, sometimes 
at a gallop. I wanted the Portuguese language to reach 
its maximum in my hands. And this desire is shared by all who write. A Camões and others alike were not enough 
to give us forever an inheritance of a language already made. 
All of us who write are making something that gives life to the grave of thought.

We have these difficulties. But I did not speak 
of the enchantment of dealing with a language that was not 
profound. What I inherited is not enough for me. 

If I were mute and also could not write, and 
they asked me which language I wanted to belong to, I would say: 
English, which is precise and beautiful. But, as I was not born mute and 
could write, it became absolutely clear to me 
that what I really wanted was to write in Portuguese. I even 
wished I had not learned other languages: just so that my 
approach to Portuguese would be virgin and clear.

Weekend at the park

Look at my people in the favelas and you will realize
From here I see a brand new car
Fully equipped and the old man driving
With his children by his side they are going to the park
Euphoric electronic toys
Automatically I imagine
The kids from the area how they are
Probably running around here and there
Playing barefoot soccer in the dirt streets
Yeah, they play the way they can
[...]
Look at that club, how cool
Look at that court, look at that field, look
Look how many people
There's an ice cream shop, cinema, hot pool
[...]
Here I don't see any sports club
No incentive for the kids to attend
The investment in leisure is very scarce
The community center is a failure

On that morning of clear sky and light air, due to the torrential rain of the previous night, I went out for a walk with the sun still hidden to take notice of the first movements of life in the countryside. It didn't take long and the intense smell of coffee brewed by Dona Linda invaded my nostrils and made hunger awaken from that lethargic state derived from the long night of sleep. I put my hands in the water that ran through the bamboo spout and the cold contact gave me goosebumps. But I went on and cupped my hands to my face. With the impact, I stepped back and momentarily lost my breath, but the awakening was immediate. Already awake, I entered the kitchen in search of quenching my hunger and getting close to the warmth of the wood stove. That's when I noticed the slender and discreet figure of a lady accompanied by a boy who seemed to be about five years old already seated at the end of the table in an intimate chat with the lady of the house. After a vigorous 'Good morning!', a warm handshake in the customary introductions, I learned that Dona Flor de Maio was taking her son Adão for treatment of the wounds that were popping up on his body, causing small pustules with reddish edges.","

 Zé Araújo began to sing in a sad tone, telling 
to the curious who began to arrive that a woman 
had knelt at the feet of the holy cross and sworn in 
the name of Jesus a great love, but swore and did not fulfill, 
pretended and deceived me, you lied to me, you sinned against God, the heart has reasons that reason itself 
does not know, makes promises and vows, then forgets.

  The caboclo was sad and inspired. After this 
song that gave Neusa goosebumps, he followed with 
a waltz even more spirited, full of difficult words, 
but beautiful as only the serene drop. It was the story of a 
charming doll seen in a crystal showcase on the 
majestic pedestal. Zé Araújo closed his eyes and let 
out his voice:

Her hair had the color/ Of the sun radiating/ 
Fulvous rays of love./ Her eyes were circunvagos/
Of the blue romanticism of lakes/ Lyrical hands, some 
divine arms,/ A white body like no other/ And the feet 
very small./ Finally I saw in this doll/ A perfect 
Venus.

I like to say. I will say it better: I like to word. Words are for me touchable bodies, visible sirens, incorporated sensuality. Perhaps because real sensuality has no interest for me of any kind - not even mental or dream - desire has transmuted into what creates verbal rhythms in me, or listens to them from others. I shudder if they say it well. Such a page of Fialho, such a page of Chateaubriand, make my whole life tingle in every vein, make me tremble tremulously quietly with an unattainable pleasure that I am having.

In the summer of 1954, the artist Robert Rauschenberg 
(b.1925) coined the term combine to refer to his 
new works that had aspects of both painting and 
sculpture.

In 1958, Bed was selected to be included in an 
exhibition of young American and Italian artists 
at the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy.
However, the festival organizers refused to 
show the work and removed it to a storage.

While the art world debated the innovation of 
hanging a bed on a wall, Rauschenberg 
considered his work 'one of the most welcoming 
paintings I've ever painted, but I've always been 
afraid someone would want to crawl into it'.

In participation sport or popular sport, the manifestation occurs in the principle of ludic pleasure, which has as its purpose the social well-being of its practitioners. It is closely associated with leisure and free time and occurs in spaces not committed to time and outside the obligations of daily life. It aims at relaxation, fun, personal development and relationship with people.

its study belongs to the most prestigious art and that

we should and should not do, the purpose of this

A society is a more or less self-sufficient association of people who in their mutual relations recognize certain rules of conduct as obligatory and who, most of the time, act accordingly. A society is well-ordered not only when it is planned to promote the well-being of its members, but also when it is effectively regulated by a public conception of justice. That is, it is a society in which everyone accepts, and knows that others accept, the same principle of justice.

The phenomenon of population mobility has been, since the last decades of the 20th century, presenting significant transformations in its behavior, not only in Brazil but also in other parts of the world. These new processes materialize, among other aspects, in the internal dimension, by redirecting migratory flows to medium-sized cities, to the detriment of large urban centers; by short-term displacements and shorter distances; by pendular movements, which become more relevant in survival strategies, no longer restricted to large urban agglomerations.

Solon is the first Greek name that comes to mind when land and debt are mentioned together.

The focus on human freedoms contrasts with more restrictive views of development, such as those that identify development with growth of the Gross National Product, or industrialization. The growth of the GNP can be very important as a means of expanding freedoms. But freedoms also depend on other determinants, such as education and health services and civil rights.

With electronic text, finally, it seems to be within reach of our eyes and hands a very ancient dream of humanity, which could be summarized in two words, universality and interactivity.

The lights, which thought that Gutenberg had provided men with a universal promise, cultivated a utopian way. They imagined being able, from the private practices of each one, to build a space for the critical exchange of ideas and opinions. Kant's dream was that each one could be at the same time reader and author, issuing judgments on the institutions of his time, whatever they were, and at the same time, could reflect on the judgment issued by others. What was once only allowed by handwritten communication or the circulation of printed matter finds today a powerful support with electronic text.

The gentleman

Letter to a young woman who, being in a circle where he gave those present the treatment of you, addressed the author as 'the gentleman':

Madam:
The one you called sir is here, with a heavy heart and a sad face, to tell you that sir he is not, of nothing, nor of anyone.

You know well, for sure, that the only nobility of the commoner is in not wanting to hide his condition, and in this nobility I have. So, if among so many rich and noble gentlemen to whom you called you chose me to address as sir, it is clear that you could only have found this lordship in the wrinkles of my forehead and in the silver of my hair. Lord of many years, here I am; the territory where I rule is in the country of time that was. That word 'sir', in the middle of a sentence, raised between us a cold and sad wall.

Fragments from the secret diary of 
Teodor Konrad Nalecz Korzeniowski

JULY 20 [1912]

Peter Sumerville asks me to write an article about 
Crane. I send him a letter: 'Believe me, dear sir, 
no newspaper or magazine would be interested in anything 
that I, or anyone else, would write about Stephen Crane. 
They would laugh at the suggestion. [...] I hardly find anyone, 
nowadays, who knows who Stephen Crane is or remembers 
anything about him. For the young writers who are emerging, he 
simply does not exist.'
DECEMBER 20 [1919]

Much fish was wrapped in newspaper. I am recognized as the greatest living writer in the English language. 
Nineteen years have passed since Crane died, 
but I do not forget him. And it seems that others don't either. 
The London Mercury decided to celebrate the twenty-five 
years of publication of a book that, according to them, was 'a 
phenomenon now forgotten' and asked me for an article.

Formerly

Formerly, the kids would hold their tongues in front of 
their parents and if one forgot to brush their teeth before 
falling into Morpheus' arms, they could get a spanking. 
They should also not forget to wash their feet, without complaining 
or mooing. No hitting the godfather's back, nor teasing the elders, as it would result in a beating. Early in the morning, 
watered the plants, went to work and soon returned home. 
They wouldn't mock around in the street, nor escape from the teacher, 
even if they didn't understand a thing about moral 
and civic instruction. The true smart one wore buttoned boots 
to show up all spruced up at the gathering, although 
at the party he would only nibble, to avoid flatulence. 
The tricky ones were a cliff, playing with a double-edged sword, so it required a lot of caution and chicken broth. It was best to be on guard in front of 
a swindler with a fancy hairdo, after outwitting and fooling the 
suckers, and before everything was settled, he 
would vanish.

Cabeludinho

When Grandma received me on vacation, she introduced me to her friends: This is my grandson. He went to study in Rio and came back as an atheist. She said I came back as an atheist. That displaced preposition fantasized me as an atheist. As if saying at Carnival: that boy is dressed as a clown. My grandmother understood verbal regencies. She spoke seriously. But everyone laughed. Because that displaced preposition could turn information into a joke. And it did. And furthermore: I think that seeking beauty in words is a solemnity of love. And it can be an instrument of laughter. Another time, in the middle of the game, a boy shouted: Disilimina that, Cabeludinho. I didn't disiliminate anyone. But that new verb brought a perfume of poetry to our court. I learned on these vacations to play with words more than work with them. I started not to like shelved words. The ones that can't change places. I learned to like words more for what they intone than for what they inform. Because later I heard a cowboy singing with longing: Oh brunette, don't write to me / because I don't know how to read. That preposition before the verb read, to my hearing, amplified the cowboy's loneliness.

Since eighteen years old, patriotism absorbed him and for it he had done the foolishness of studying useless things. What did the rivers matter to him? Were they big? So be it... How would knowing the names of the heroes of Brazil contribute to his happiness? In nothing... The important thing is that he had been happy. Had he? No. He remembered the things of the Tupi, the folklore, his agricultural attempts... Was there any satisfaction left in his soul from all that? None! None!

The Tupi encountered general incredulity, laughter, mockery, scorn; and it drove him to madness. A disappointment. And agriculture? Nothing. The lands were not fertile and it was not as easy as the books said. Another disappointment. And when his patriotism became combative, what did he find? Disappointments. Where was the sweetness of our people? Didn't he see them fighting like beasts? Didn't he see them killing prisoners, countless? Another disappointment. His life was a disappointment, a series, better, a chain of disappointments.

The galloping march of technologies had as its first 
result to multiply in huge proportions both the 
mass of news circulating and the occasions of 
being solicited by them. Professionals tend 
to consider this 
inflation as automatically 
favorable to the public, as they take advantage of it and become 
obssessed with the liberal image of the great market 
in which each one, endowed with lights by definition equal, 
can make their choice in complete freedom. This 
has never been achieved and tends to never be. In fact, readers, 
listeners, viewers, even if they indulge in their 
bulimia*, are not really nourished by this indigestible 
soup of information and their search ends in frustration. 
More and more frequently, they even resent 
this bombardment of false riches as aggressive and 
retreat into resistance to any or all information.

The real problem of post-
industrial societies is not poverty**, but abundance. Modern societies have at their disposal much more 
than they need in objects, information and contacts. 
Or, more precisely, this results in a 
disharmony between an offer, not excessive, but incoherent, and a 
demand that, confusedly, requires a much 
quicker choice to absorb. Therefore, information outlets 
must choose, since contemporary man 
hurried, stressed, disoriented seeks a 
guideline, a clearer classification, a condensed version of 
what is truly important.
(*) excessive hunger, uncontrolled desire.
(**) misery, poverty.

The characteristic of radio orality, then, would be the one that proposes dialogue with the listener: simplicity, in the sense of lexical choice; conciseness and coherence, which are translated into a short text, in colloquial language and with direct organization; and rhythm, marked by the speaker, which should be as natural as possible (from dialogue). It is this organization that will 'govern' the transmission of the message, whether it is interpreted or improvised, with the aim of giving melody to oral transmission, giving emotion, personality to the account of fact.

A letter from a listener who writes to us
And signs with the simple pseudonym of

She tells us that on the day that would be
the happiest day of her life

A truck driver known in the small and
peaceful town of Miracema do Norte
Fled, disappeared, vanished
Oh! Arlindo Orlando come back

Come back to the bosom of your beloved
She hopes to see that truck coming back

I am happy for the friends I have. One of them 
very much suffers from my carelessness with the vernacular. For 
some years he systematically sent me erudite missives 
with precise information about the rules 
of grammar, which I did not respect, and about the correct spelling 
of words, which I ignored. I made him suffer for the 
wrong use I made of a word in one of my 
trinkets. It turns out that I, used to talking 
to people from Minas Gerais, spoke of 'varreção' —
from the verb 'varrer'. In fact, it is a mistake 
that, in a college entrance exam, could have earned me a failure. 
Because my friend, a paladin of the Portuguese language, 
took the trouble to make a photocopy of page 827 of the 
dictionary, the one that has, at the top, a photograph of a 
'varroa' (sic!) (do you know what a 'varroa' is?) 
to correct me of my mistake. And I confess: he is right. 
The right word is 'varrição' and not 'varreção'. But I am afraid that the country folk from Minas will make fun of me 
because I have never seen them talk about 'varrição'. And if they laugh at 
me it will not help me to show them the photocopy of the dictionary page 
with the 'varroa' at the top. Because for them 
it is not the dictionary that makes the language. It is the people. And the people, 
up in the mountains of Minas Gerais, say 'varreção' 
when not 'barreção'. What makes me sad about 
this hidden friend is that he has never said anything about 
what I write, if it is beautiful or if it is ugly. He takes my

Interview with Marcos Bagno

It may seem unbelievable, but many of the prescriptions of traditional language pedagogy to this day are based on the usages that Portuguese writers from the 19th century made of the language. If so many people condemn, for example, the use of the verb 'ter' instead of 'haver', as in 'hoje tem feijoada', it is simply because the Portuguese, at a certain moment in the history of their language, stopped making this existential use of the verb 'ter'. However, we have written records from the medieval period in which hundreds of these usages appear. If we, Brazilians, as well as African Portuguese speakers, still use the verb 'ter' existentially today, it is because we received these usages from our former colonizers. It makes no sense to imagine that Brazilians, Angolans, and Mozambicans decided to 'err' in the same thing. And the same happens with many other things: verbal regencies, pronominal placement, nominal and verbal agreements, etc. We have our own language, but we are still obliged to follow normative grammar of a different language. On the eve of celebrating our bicentennial of independence, it makes no sense to continue rejecting what is ours to only accept what comes from outside.

It makes no sense to reject the language of 190 million Brazilians to only consider correct what is used by less than ten million Portuguese. Just in the city of São Paulo, we have more Portuguese speakers than in the whole of Europe!

The lexicon and culture

Potentially, all languages of all times can apply to express any content. Linguistic research of the 20th century demonstrated that there is no qualitative difference between the languages of the world - that is, there are no grammatically more primitive or more developed languages. However, for this potential equality to be effectively used, it needs to be realized in the historical practice of the language, which does not always happen. Theoretically, a language with little written tradition (such as Brazilian indigenous languages) or an extinct language (such as classical Latin or Greek) can be used to talk about any subject, such as, let's say, quantum physics or molecular biology. In practice, however, it is not possible, from one moment to another, to express such content in Camaiurá or Latin, simply because there would be no specific vocabulary for these contents. It is perfectly possible to develop this specific vocabulary, either through borrowing from other languages or by creating new terms in the language in question, but such a task would not be accomplished quickly or with little effort.

Contemporary studies show that each language has its own complexity and dynamics of operation. The text highlights this dynamic, as it emphasizes","{'A': 'the absence of common content to all languages, as the lexicon contemplates a specific particular worldview of a culture.', 'B': 'the existence of languages limited by not allowing the native speaker to communicate perfectly about any content.', 'C': 'the tendency for the vocabulary and grammar of indigenous languages to be more restricted, when compared to other languages of European origin.', 'D': 'the existence of vocabulary differences between languages, specificities related to the culture of speakers of a community.', 'E': 'the attribution of greater sociocultural importance to contemporary languages, as they allow any themes to be addressed without difficulties.'}","{'D': 'the existence of vocabulary differences between languages, specificities related to the culture of speakers of a community.'}",No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,,,,,"LANGUAGES, CODES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES",YELLOW,

The replacement of 'haver' by 'ter' in existential constructions in Brazilian Portuguese corresponds to one of the most characteristic processes in the history of the Portuguese language, parallel to what had already occurred in relation to the expansion of the domain of 'ter' in the semantic area of 'possession' at the end of the archaic phase. Mattos e Silva (2001:136) analyzes the victories of 'ter' over 'haver' and discusses the emergence of existential 'ter', based on the pedagogical work of João de Barros. In texts written in the forties and fifties of the sixteenth century, there is evidence, although rare, of both 'existential' 'ter', not mentioned by the classic studies of historical syntax, and 'haver' as an existential verb with agreement, remembered by Ivo Castro, and noted as 'novelty' in the eighteenth century by Said Ali.

As seen, nothing is categorical and narrow purism only reveals a deficient knowledge of the language. There are more questions than answers. Can a single prescriptive norm be conceived? Is it valid to confuse good use and norm with the language itself and thus make a critical and hierarchical evaluation of other uses and, through them, of the users? Is one norm replaced by another?

“He was the king's enemy,” in the words of his biographer, 
Lira Neto. Or, still, “a novelist who collected enemies, 
bothered D. Pedro II and ended up inventing 
Brazil.” This was José de Alencar (1829-1877), the 
well-known author of O Guarani and Iracema, considered the father 
of the novel in Brazil. In addition to creating classics of Brazilian literature with nativist, indianist, and historical themes, he 
was also a feuilletonist, newspaper director, playwright,

The Yanomami constitute an indigenous society 
in the north of the Amazon and form a broad 
linguistic and cultural set. For the Yanomami, urihi, the “land-
forest”, is not a mere inert scenario, object of economic exploitation, but a living entity, animated by a dynamic of exchanges among the various beings that inhabit it. The forest has a vital breath, wixia, which is very long. If we do not deforest it, it will not die. It does not decompose, that is, it does not break down. It is thanks to its 
moist breath that plants grow. The forest is not 
dead because, if it were, the forests would not have leaves. 
Nor would water be seen. According to the Yanomami, if the 
whites make them disappear to deforest it and live 
in their place, they will become poor and end up hungry and 
thirsty.

Dramatic genre is one in which the artist uses 
as an intermediary between himself and the public the representation. The 
word comes from the Greek drao (to do) and means action. The 
theatrical play is, therefore, a literary composition intended for 
presentation by actors on a stage, acting and 
dialoguing among themselves. The dramatic text is complemented 
by the actors' performance in the theatrical show and has 
a specific structure, characterized: 1) by the presence 
of characters that must be logically linked to each other and to the action; 2) by the dramatic action (plot, 
storyline), which is the set of dramatic acts, ways of 
being and acting of the characters linked to the unity of 
effect and according to an order composed of exposition, 
conflict, complication, climax and denouement; 3) by the situation 
or environment, which is the set of physical, 
social, spiritual circumstances in which the action takes place; 4) by the theme, 
that is, the idea that the author (playwright) wishes to expose, or 
its real interpretation through the representation.

The heron turns around, 
Sits on the edge of the beach. 
And the cuitelinho doesn't like it 
When the rosebud falls. 
 
When I came from my land, 
I said goodbye to my relatives. 
I entered Mato Grosso, 
Reached Paraguayan lands.

Beats one and another stripe. 
And the eyes fill with water

The dance is important for the Indian to prepare the body and throat and means energy for the body, which becomes robust. In the village, for physical preparation, we dance from five in the morning until six in the afternoon, spending the whole day dancing when the godparents plan the dance of the adolescents. The godparent is like a teacher, a physical trainer for the adolescents. For example, the godparent dreams of a certain chant and plans for everyone to sing. All types of dance come from the first Xavantes: Wamarĩdzadadzeiwawẽ, Butséwawẽ, Tseretomodzatsewawẽ, who discovered through wisdom how Xavante culture would be. To this day, this culture, this celebration exists. When the adolescent pierces the ear, it is mandatory for him to dance all night, he has to wake up at midnight to dance and sing, it is mandatory, they keep calling each other with a special shout.

in the “Brazilian language”, a nefarious refuge and disgusting confession

If sharks were men 

If sharks were men, would they be kinder to the small fish? 
 
Certainly, if sharks were men, 
they would build sturdy cages in the sea for the small fish, with all kinds of food, both animal and vegetable. They would ensure that the cages always had fresh water and would adopt all sanitary measures. 
 
Of course, there would also be schools in the cages. In classes, the little fish would learn how to swim to the sharks' throats. They would learn, for example, 
how to use geography to locate the big sharks 
lying lazily around. The main lesson would be, 
of course, the moral formation of the little fish. They would be taught that the greatest and most sublime act is the joyful sacrifice of a little fish and that everyone should believe in the sharks, especially when they said they were taking care of their future happiness. The little fish 
would know that this future would only be guaranteed if 
they learned obedience. 
 
Every little fish that in war killed some 
enemy little fish would be decorated with a small 
Order of the Algae and would receive the title of hero.

Text II 
Raduan Nassar launched the novella A Glass of Wrath in 1978, a fervent narrative of a verbal confrontation between lovers, in which the fury of cutting words shattered in the air. The conjugal clash echoed the authoritarian discourse of power and submission of a Brazil that lived under the yoke of military dictatorship.

Confidence of the Itabirano 

 
Some years I lived in Itabira. 
Mainly I was born in Itabira. 
That's why I'm sad, proud: of iron. 
Ninety percent of iron on the sidewalks. 
Eighty percent of iron in the souls. 
And this aloofness from what in life is porosity and 
communication. 

 
The will to love, which paralyzes my work, 
comes from Itabira, from its white nights, without women and 
without horizons. 

And the habit of suffering, which amuses me so much, 
is a sweet Itabiran inheritance. 
 
From Itabira I brought various gifts that I now offer you: 
this iron stone, future steel of Brazil, 
this Saint Benedict of the old sculptor Alfredo Duval; 
this antelope leather, spread on the living room sofa; 
this pride, this bowed head... 
 
I had gold, I had cattle, I had farms. 
Today I am a civil servant. 
Itabira is just a photograph on the wall. 
But how it hurts!

Carlos Drummond de Andrade is one of the exponents of the Brazilian modernist movement. With his poems, he delved deep into the soul of Brazil and poetically worked on human anxieties and dilemmas.

The main criteria to be observed for capturing and storing rainwater are: the daily water demand on the property; the average precipitation index (rain), by region, in each period of the year; the time required for storage; and the necessary or available roof area for capturing. To calculate the volume of a cistern, an additional amount related to the evaporation coefficient should be added. In the difficulty of establishing a reliable coefficient, the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA) suggests that 10% be added to the calculated water volume.

Cancer 21/06 to 21/07

The eclipse in your sign will trigger changes in your self-esteem and in your way of acting. The body will indicate where you fail - if you have been swallowing toads, the gastric area will suffer. What has been stored will come to the surface to be transformed, as this new cycle requires a 'detoxification'. Be moderate in your actions, as you will need energy to recover. There is concern about the family, and communication between siblings is blocked. Remember: a precious word is a word spoken at the right time. This also helps in love life, which will be tested. Better to contain expectations and be calm, evaluating your own shortcomings in a mature way. You will feel the desire to look beyond material issues - your confidence will come from intimacy with soul matters.

Why do we pronounce many words differently from the way they are written? This aspect of the language can be reflected upon from two perspectives. In the first one, speech and writing are dichotomous, which restricts language teaching to the code. Hence the understanding that 
writing is more complex than speech, and its teaching 
is restricted to knowledge of grammatical rules, without 
concern for usage situations. Another approach 
allows us to see the differences as a distinct product 
of two language modalities: oral and written. The 
question is that we do not always realize this.

One of these days I decided to take a test proposed by a website. The name of the test was tempting: “What would Freud say about you”. Wow. I answered all the questions and the result was as follows: “The events of your childhood marked you until the age of twelve, after that you sought intellectual knowledge for your maturation”. Perfect! That's exactly what happened to me. I was thrilled: I had just had a paranormal consultation with the father of psychoanalysis, and he hit the nail on the head. I had some spare time, and curiosity is something I don't lack, so I decided to go back to the test and answer everything differently from what I had answered before. I marked some bizarre alternatives that had nothing to do with my personality. And I went to check the result, which said the following: “The events of your childhood marked you until the age of 12, after that you sought intellectual knowledge for your maturation”.

The compulsive eating disorder has been recognized in recent years as a syndrome characterized by episodes of excessive and compulsive food intake, however, unlike bulimia nervosa, these people do not try to avoid weight gain with compensatory methods. The episodes are accompanied by a feeling of lack of control over the act of eating, feelings of guilt and shame.

Many people with this syndrome are obese, presenting a history of weight variation, as food is used to deal with psychological problems. The compulsive eating disorder is found in about 2% of the general population, more often affecting women between 20 and 30 years old. Research shows that 30% of people seeking treatment for obesity or weight loss have compulsive eating disorder.

To enter, it is necessary to choose a nickname, a kind of alias that will identify the participant during the conversation.

A small invention, Wikipedia, has changed the way we deal with information on the web. It is a collaborative virtual encyclopedia, which is made and updated by any internet user who has something to contribute. In short: it's as if you printed a new page for the outdated publication you found in the library.
In the past, when we needed reliable information, we had the encyclopedia as a safe source of research for work, studies, and research in general. However, the novelty brought by Wikipedia puts us in a new circumstance, where we cannot fully trust what we read.
Having collective writing as its main motto, its texts bring information that can be edited and reedited by people from all over the world. In other words, the relevance of the information is not determined by cultural tradition, as in the old encyclopedias, but by the dynamics of the media.
Thus, the possibility of finding correct information among deliberate sabotage and wrong contributions is questioned.

On the left bank of the Belém river, at the back of the fish market, 
stands the old inga tree - there the drunks 
are happy. Curitiba considers them sacred animals, 
provides for their needs of cachaça and porridge. 
In the trivial, they contented themselves with the market leftovers.

Already the pallor of death covers my face,
In my lips the breath faints,
Deaf agony the heart fades,
And devours my mortal being with grief!

In vain from the bed on the soft support
I try to retain sleep!... it already fades
The exhausted body that forgets rest...
Here is the state in which sorrow has placed me!

The farewell, your farewell, my longing,
Make me insane and deprive me of living
And have my eyes in the darkness.

Give me the hope with which I sustained being!
Turn the eyes back to the lover out of pity,
Eyes for whom lived the one who no longer lives!

The so-called 'passive smoker' is the individual who does not smoke, but ends up breathing the smoke from cigarettes smoked around them. To this day, the effects of passive smoking are widely discussed, but one thing is certain: those who do not smoke are not obliged to breathe in the smoke of others. Passive smoking is a public health problem in all countries of the world. In Europe, it is estimated that 79% of people are exposed to 'second-hand' smoke, while in the United States, 88% of non-smokers end up smoking passively.

Study conducted by researchers from the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation on teenagers recruited by drug trafficking in the Rio de Janeiro slums exposes the social bases of these gangs, contributing to explain the difficulties that the State faces in combating organized crime.
Trafficking offers young people with poor education (none of the interviewees had completed elementary school) a well-structured career plan, with salaries ranging from R$ 400.00 to R$ 12,000 monthly. For a comparison base, it is worth noting that, according to IBGE data from 2001, 59% of the Brazilian population over ten years old who declare to have a paid activity earn at most the 'minimum wage' offered by crime. Of the traffickers interviewed in the research, 25% earned more than R$ 2,000 monthly; in the Brazilian population, this rate does not exceed 6%.
Such incomes show that compensatory social policies, such as Bolsa-Escola (which pays R$ 15 monthly per enrolled student), are by themselves unable to prevent drug trafficking from continuing to recruit children from low-income strata: such policies alleviate the family budget a little and encourage parents to keep their children studying, which in no way prevents the option for delinquency. Similarly, programs aimed at vulnerable youth to organized crime (circus-schools, cultural workshops, soccer schools) are important, but do not solve the problem.
The only way to reduce the attraction exerted by trafficking is repression, which increases the risks for those who choose this path. The incomes paid to adolescents prove this: they are high precisely because the possibility of being arrested is not negligible. It is necessary for the federal and state Executives to dismantle the parallel organizations erected by the gangs, so that the certainty of punishment eliminates the allure of crime salaries.

Excellency so that a calamity that is about to fall upon the female youth of Brazil can be conjured.

A servant brought the coffee. Rubião picked up the cup and, while 
sprinkling sugar in it, discreetly gazed at the tray, 
which was made of engraved silver. Silver, gold, were the metals he 
loved; he did not like bronze, but his friend 
Palha told him it was a matter of price, and that explains 
this pair of figures that are here in the room: a Mephistopheles and a Faust. However, if he had to choose, he would choose the tray, — a masterpiece of silversmithing, finely executed and finished. 
The servant waited stiff and serious. He was Spanish; and it was not without 
resistance that Rubião accepted him from Cristiano's hands; no matter 
how much he told him that he was used to his 
Minas slaves, and did not want foreign tongues at home, 
his friend Palha insisted, demonstrating the need to 
have white servants. Rubião reluctantly agreed. His good 
page, whom he wanted to place in the room, as a piece of the 
province, could not even be left in the kitchen, where a 
Frenchman, Jean, reigned; he was degraded to other services.

I love the street. This feeling of very intimate nature 
would not be revealed by me if I did not judge, and reasons 
had not to judge, that this love so absolute and 
so exaggerated is shared by all of you. We are 
brothers, we feel similar and equal; in cities, 
in villages, in settlements, not because we suffer, with 
pain and displeasures, the law and the police, but because 
the love of the street unites us, levels us and brings us together. This is

like life itself, resists ages and epochs.

Six Brazilian states took advantage of the increase in the number of donors and transplants performed in the first semester of 2012 in the country and joined a privileged list: that of no longer having patients waiting for a cornea.

Psychology of a defeated

I, son of carbon and ammonia,
Monster of darkness and brilliance,
I suffer, since childhood's epigenesis,
The bad influence of the zodiac signs.
Profoundly hypochondriac,
This environment causes me disgust...
A similar urge rises to my mouth
To the urge that escapes from a cardiac's mouth.
And the worm - this worker of ruins -
Who eats the rotten blood of carnage,
And declares war on life in general,
Is lurking to gnaw my eyes,
And will leave me only with my hair,

answer or is a promise of refusal:

- God forbid, no! Not today...
Abílio questioned the old lady:

the deal. With Mrs. Julietinha it was like this. He approached:

- How's business?

She smiled, eyes down. Abílio watched the comet
leave. Early in the morning he jumped over the fence. Agreed signal,
two knocks on the kitchen door. The lady came out to the
yard, careful not to wake the children. He brought the
travel cape, spread out on the dewy grass.

The neighbor spied on the two, learned the signal. Decided
to imitate the feat. At dusk, pum-pum, two strong knocks
on the door. The husband traveling, but it wasn't Abílio's day. Suspicious, the girl appeared at the window and the neighbor repeated:

- So you want the old man and not the young man? Look

The last edition of this journal presents once again a theme related to the treatment given to household waste, the one we produce on a daily basis. The information now addresses the problem of material thrown on the local road that connects the municipality of Rio Claro to the district of Ajapi. Unfortunately, at the site in question, the report found another wrong way of disposing of the garbage: material thrown beside the road as if this were ideal. Many residents, for example, remove the garbage from their homes and, instead of a correct destination, try to dispose of it in other regions. A situation that is at least uncomfortable. If you leave home to throw the garbage in another location, why not do it in the ideal place? It is very rude to think that what is not correct for your region may be for another. Recycling household waste is a smart and conscious step. Look at the example we set for the younger ones! Those who learn wrong put the wrong into practice. A danger!

On a scale of 0 to 10, Brazil is between 3 and 4 in terms of information security. 'We are starting to wake up to the problem. In this corporate espionage story, we have a lot to learn. There is a lack of institutional awareness and a long learning process. Society has realized that it is something that affects us,' says S.P., a post-doctorate in information security. According to him, channels for reporting this type of situation should be established. According to the Internet Management Committee (CGI) advisor, Brazil has the conditions to develop its own technology to ensure the security of the country's data, both government and population. 'There is a wealth of knowledge within universities and innovative companies that can contribute by proposing measures so that we can change this [lack of security] in the long term.' He believes that the government must use its purchasing power for software and hardware in the cybersecurity area to promote these companies, the production of knowledge in the field, and the construction of a national production chain.

The exercise of the chronicle

Writing prose is an ungrateful art. I say random prose, as a chronicler does; not the prose of a fiction writer, in which the writer is somewhat slapped by the characters and situations that, unfortunately for him, he created because he wanted to. With an everyday prose writer, things get more delicate. He sits in front of his machine, looks out the window, and deeply searches his imagination for any fact, preferably taken from the morning news, or the day before, in which, with his peculiar tricks, he can inject some fresh blood. If there is nothing, he has the resource of looking around and waiting for, through an associative process, the chronicle to suddenly emerge, coming from the facts and deeds of his emotionally awakened life by concentration. Or else, as a last resort, resort to the subject of the lack of subject, already quite worn out, but from which, in the act of writing, the unexpected may arise.

And if drinking water runs out? What would happen if the world's drinking water ran out?

The most pessimistic theories say that drinking water 
should run out soon, by 2050. In that year, no one will 
take a shower every day. Shower with water only twice 
a week. If someone exceeds 55 liters of consumption 
(half of what the UN recommends), their supply will be 
interrupted. In the markets, there would be no meat, because if there is no 
water for you, imagine for the cattle. 43 thousand liters 
of water are spent to produce 1 kg of meat. But it's not just it 
that will be missing. The Midwest Region of Brazil, the largest grain producer 
in Latin America in 2012, would not be able to maintain 
production. After all, in the country, agriculture and livestock 
are, today, the largest water consumers, with more than 
70% of use. Rice, beans, soybeans, corn and other grains would be missing.

In Brazil, the origin of funk and hip-hop dates back to the 1970s, when the proliferation of the so-called 'black dances' in the outskirts of major urban centers. Fueled by American black music, thousands of young people found in weekend dances a leisure alternative that did not exist before. In cities like Rio de Janeiro or São Paulo, sound teams were formed that promoted dances where a style seeking the valorization of black culture spread, both in music and in clothes and hairstyles. In Rio de Janeiro, it became known as 'Black Rio'. The music industry discovered the goldmine and, by releasing 'team' records with the successful songs at the dances, spread the trend throughout the rest of the country.

The strong presence of indigenous and African words and terms brought by immigrants from the 19th century is one of the traits that distinguish Brazilian Portuguese from Portuguese from Portugal. However, looking at the history of loans that Brazilian Portuguese received from European languages from the 20th century, another difference also appears: with the arrival of the Portuguese royal family in Brazil (1808) and, particularly, with Independence, Portugal ceased to be the mandatory intermediary for the assimilation of these loans, and thus Brazil and Portugal began to diverge, not only because they suffered different influences, but also by the way they reacted to them.

Medical evidence suggests that dietary supplementation can be beneficial for a small group of people, including competitive athletes, whose diet is not balanced. It has been observed that adolescents involved in physical or athletic activity are increasingly using such supplements. The prevalence of this use varies among types of sports, cultural aspects, age groups (more common in adolescents), and gender (higher prevalence in males). Few studies refer to the frequency, type, and amount of supplements used, but it seems common for recommended doses to be exceeded.

The media is one of the important stimuli for the use of dietary supplements by conveying, for example, the myth of the ideal body. In 2001, the dietary supplements industry globally invested US$ 46 billion in advertising, as a means to persuade potential consumers to acquire their products. In adolescence, a period of self-affirmation, many of them spare no efforts to achieve this goal.

The Brazil is sertanejo

What type of music symbolizes Brazil? Here is a question that has been discussed for a long time, arousing extreme opinions. There are fundamentalists who wish to impose on the public a type of sound born from the sociocultural roots of the country. The samba. Others, equally nationalist, despise everything that has no style. They dream of the empire of MPB by Chico Buarque and Caetano Veloso. A third group, made up of younger people, only listen to and cultivate international music, in all its forms. And more or less ignore the rest.

The reality of Brazilian musical habits is now clear, it has nothing to do with these stereotypes. The genre that enchants more than half of the country is sertanejo, followed from afar by MPB and pagode. Other genres on the rise, especially among classes C, D, and E, are funk and religious music, especially gospel. Rock and electronic music are minority music.

This is demonstrated by a pioneering survey conducted between August 2012 and August 2013 by the Brazilian Institute of Public Opinion and Statistics (Ibope). The musical Tribes survey the behavior of radio listeners from a new perspective, paints a picture of the Brazilian listener and brings some news. For those who thought that MPB and samba still resisted as bastions of nationality, bad news: the two genres have been surpassed in popularity. Modern Brazil no longer has the sound profile of the 1970s that many would like to perpetuate. The musical face of the country is now different.

Linotypes

The Press Museum exhibits two linotypes. It is a type of lead type composition machine, invented in 1884 in Baltimore, United States, by the German Ottmar Mergenthaler. The invention was of great importance as it represented a new and fundamental advance in the history of graphic arts. Linotype actually caused a revolution because it overcame the slowness of text composition carried out in traditional typography, where the text was composed by hand, joining movable types one by one. It was thus the main means of typographic composition until 1950. Linotype, from the late 19th century, began to produce printed materials at low cost, which brought information to the masses, democratized information. It promoted a revolution in education. Before linotype, newspapers and magazines were scarce, with few pages and expensive. Textbooks were also expensive, not very accessible.

Cordel resists graphic technology

Cariri maintains one of the richest traditions of popular culture. It is the cordel literature, which crosses the centuries without being destroyed by the avalanche of modernity that invades the lyrical and telluric backlands. Against progress, which computerized the graphic industry, Lira Nordestina, from Juazeiro do Norte, and the Academy of Cordelists of Crato preserve, in their workshops, old machines for printing their cordels.

The plate for printing the cordel is made by hand, letter by letter, a craftsmanship that takes about an hour to make a page. Then, the plate is taken to the printer, also manual, to print. Maintaining this old printing system is part of the work philosophy. The other step is the making of the woodcut for the cordel cover.

Woodcuts are popular illustrations obtained by engravings carved in wood. The origin of the northeastern woodcut is still unknown. It is believed that Portuguese missionaries taught their technique to the Indians, as an extra-catechesis activity, based on the religious principle that defends the need to occupy the hands so that the mind does not remain free, subject to evil thoughts, to sin. Woodcut preceded the cliché, a relief photomechanically engraved plate on metal, usually zinc, which was used in newspapers printed on rotogravure presses.

performs very well.

Those who found this sentence natural, beware! They will not 
know how to say that they saw a movie with an actor who 
works well. And they will go for a sea bath instead of going to the beach, 
dressed in swimwear instead of a bikini, carrying 
a parasol instead of a tent. They will buy an automobile 
instead of buying a car, they will catch a flux instead 
of a cold, they will walk on the sidewalk instead of strolling

Reading has been on the agenda for a long time. And, it is said, in crisis. This crisis is commented on, for example, pointing out the precariousness of reading practices, lamenting the lack of familiarity of young people with books, complaining about the lack of libraries in so many municipalities, the price of books in bookstores, in a never-ending list of problems and shortages. But, for some time now, academic research has been saying that maybe it is not exactly like that, that Brazilians do read, but they read books that traditional research does not take into account. And, also for some time now, educational policies have taken to heart investing in books and reading.

Street vendors

Blessed be the street vendor of penny toys:
The one who sells colorful balloons
The little monkey climbing the coconut tree
The little dog wagging its tail
The little men boxing
The green frog that suddenly jumps so funny
And the fountain pens that will never write anything.

Joy of the sidewalks
Some talk too much:
	 'The gentleman comes home and says: My son, go get a
piece of banana for me to light the cigar.
Naturally the boy will think: Dad is crazy...'

Others, poor things, have their tongues tied.

However, they all know how to handle the strings with the naive instinct of
creators of useless things.
And they teach in the chaos of the streets the heroic myths of childhood...
And they give to the passing men, worried or sad, a lesson of childhood.

Perhaps the scruple of Cotrim may seem excessive to those who do not know that he possessed a fiercely honorable character. I myself was unfair to him during the years that followed my father's inventory. I recognize that he was a role model. They accused him of being greedy, and I think they were right; but greed is just an exaggeration of a virtue, and virtues should be like budgets: the surplus is better than the deficit. As he was very dry in his manners, he had enemies who went as far as accusing him of being barbaric. The only fact alleged in this regard was that he frequently sent slaves to the dungeon, from where they came out dripping with blood; but, besides the fact that he only sent the wicked and the runaways, it happens that, having long engaged in smuggling slaves, he had become accustomed in a certain way to a slightly harsher treatment than that kind of business required, and one cannot honestly attribute to a man's original nature what is purely the effect of social relations. The proof that Cotrim had pious feelings was found in his love for his children, and in the pain he suffered when Sara died a few months later; irrefutable proof, I think, and not unique. He was treasurer of a brotherhood, and a brother of several fraternities, and even a redeemed brother of one of them, which does not quite match the reputation of greed; the truth is that the benefit did not fall to the ground: the brotherhood (of which he had been a judge) had ordered his oil portrait to be taken.

The Incas developed a way to record quantities and represent numbers using a positional decimal numbering system: a set of strings with knots called quipus. The quipus were made of a matrix string, or main (thicker than the others), on which other strings, thinner, of different sizes and colors (hanging strings) were hung. According to their position, the knots represented units, tens, hundreds, and thousands. In Figure 1, the quipus represents the decimal number 2,453.

The idea that the world is created by the word, however, is so structuring that it is present in other religions, far beyond those founded in Christianity.

The pessimist
Gabriel García Márquez
Gerineldo sleeps because he is already resigned to his world. Because he already knows everything that can happen to him after subjecting all the objects around him to a meticulous inventory of possibilities. His apartment, more than an apartment, is a theory of luck and misfortune. Better than anyone, Gerineldo knows the coefficient of expansion of his windows and keeps marked on the thermometer, with a red line, the point at which the glass will break, shattered into shards of death. He knows that architects and engineers have already predicted everything, except what has never happened before.

Being and Nothingness: An Essay on Phenomenological Ontology

The situation is the whole subject (he is nothing but his situation) and is also the whole thing (there is never anything but things). It is the subject elucidating things by its own overcoming, if we wish; or it is things sending back to the subject his image. It is total facticity, the absolute contingency of the world, of my birth, of my place, of my past, of my surroundings - and it is my limitless freedom that makes facticity exist for me.

### Molecular Biology of the Cell
ATP production depends on the proton gradient generated by the respiratory chain. In these reactions, according to the scheme, electrons from the oxidation of NADH to positively charged NAD travel through the chain until they reach cytochrome c oxidase, reducing the iron from a 3 positive charge to a 2 positive charge. Oxygen acts as the final acceptor of these electrons, forming water. Cyanide is a highly toxic chemical species that has a high affinity for the 3 positive charge iron. When cells are exposed to cyanide, it binds to the 3 positive charge iron site of cytochrome c oxidase, preventing its conversion to a 2 positive charge iron and blocking the respiratory chain.

Amazonian soils, rich in silicate, are not suitable for cultivation because they are unable to retain nutrients. However, archaeological discoveries have shown that the ancient inhabitants of the Amazon mastered the technique of preparing a natural agricultural input, called black earth. This input consisted mainly of a type of biochar obtained from the burning of organic matter, such as tree trunks, pieces of bones, and manure, capable of keeping the soil fertile for years.
It is admitted that the effect of biochar on soil fertilization was, in part, related to the presence of carboxylate organic groups on its surface, negatively charged (single COO bond with negative charge). These groups attract positive ions necessary as nutrients, such as those from potassium, calcium, and magnesium, as well as micronutrients, such as zinc and iron. This bond in the fertilized soil is predominantly ionic, as illustrated in the figure, where M of positive charge n represents the metallic cations.

179,2023,"Let a, b, and c be the measures of the sides of a right triangle, with a as the measure of the hypotenuse. These values a, b, and c are, respectively, the diameters of the circles C1, C2, and C3, as presented in the figure.
This construction ensures, by the Pythagorean theorem, that the area of C1 is equal to the area of C2 plus the area of C3.
A mathematics teacher was aware of this construction and, socializing with two friends in a pizzeria where pizzas are only sold in a circular shape, issued a challenge: even without using a measuring instrument, he could assert with certainty whether the area of the corresponding pizza he ordered was greater, equal, or less than the sum of the areas of the pizzas of his two friends. Thus, three pizzas were ordered. The teacher divided them in half and formed a triangle with the diameters of the pizzas, as indicated in the figure.
Based on the measurement of the angle alpha, the teacher stated that the area of his pizza is greater than the sum of the areas of the other two pizzas.","Description of the figure: The figure presents a right triangle with sides a, b, and c; circle C1, which has side a of the triangle as diameter; circle C2, which has side b of the triangle as diameter, and circle C3, which has side c of the triangle as diameter.","Description of the figure: Figure of a triangle, in which one of the angles has a measure equal to alpha and each of its sides is the diameter of a semicircle. The semicircle, whose diameter is the side opposite to the angle alpha, represents the half pizza of the mathematics teacher; the other two semicircles represent the half pizza of friend 1 and the half pizza of friend 2.",The area of the mathematics teacher's pizza is greater than the sum of the areas of the other two pizzas because,,,,,,,Yes,True,True,"['https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piresramon/gpt-4-enem/main/data/figures/2023/day_2/fileoutpart88.png', 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piresramon/gpt-4-enem/main/data/figures/2023/day_2/fileoutpart89.png']",,MATHEMATICS AND ITS TECHNOLOGIES,"{'A': '0 degrees < alpha < 90 degrees', 'B': 'alpha = 90 degrees.', 'C': '90 degrees < alpha < 180 degrees.', 'D': 'alpha = 180 degrees.', 'E': '180 degrees < alpha < 360 degrees.'}",
