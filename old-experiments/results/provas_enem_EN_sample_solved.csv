If, then, for the things we do there is an end 
that we desire for its own sake and everything else is desired 
in the interest of that end; evidently such an end will be the good, 
or rather, the supreme good. But will not knowledge, 
perhaps, have great influence on this life? If so, 
let us strive to determine, even if only in general terms, what it is and from which of the sciences or 
faculties it constitutes the object. No one will doubt that 
its study belongs to the most prestigious art and that 
more truly can be called the master art. 
Now, politics shows to be of this nature, for it is she who 
determines which sciences should be studied 
in a State, which are those that each citizen should 
learn, and to what extent; and we see that even the most esteemed faculties, such as strategy, economics and 
rhetoric, are subject to it. Now, as politics uses 
the other sciences and, on the other hand, legislates on what 
we should and should not do, the purpose of this 
science must encompass those of the others, so that this

He moved slowly, swaying all his fringes and vigorously fanning himself with one of those sandalwood wooden fans, which enveloped him in a nauseating wave of perfume. I don't know exactly what he had put on his head, it looked more like a turban or a hat without brims from which vigorous strands of blond hair emerged.

Therefore, the reduction needed is R$ 18.00 - R$ 15.30 = R$ 2.70.

There is a fear on the part of parents and some teachers that children will unlearn when browsing, fear of them becoming addicted, of obtaining unreliable information, of isolating themselves from the real world, as if the computer were an agent of evil, a villain. This fear is reinforced by the media, which usually presents the computer as a negative agent in learning and in the socialization of users. We know that no one is at risk of unlearning when browsing, whether in digital environments or in printed materials, but it is necessary to see what is being learned and sometimes interfere in this process in order to optimize or guide learning, showing users other themes, other paths, other possibilities different from those they found on their own or those they usually use. It is necessary, sometimes, to negotiate the use so that it is not exclusive, since there are other means of communication, other means of information, and other leisure alternatives.

Solve for t to find t = 2.8 seconds. Then, calculate the distance traveled by the attentive driver using the formula s = ut + 0.5at². Substitute the values to find s = 19.6 m. Next, calculate the time it takes for the distracted driver to stop, which is 1 second longer than the attentive driver, so t = 3.8 seconds.

112,2023,"## The aircraft crew member and ionizing radiation
Cosmic rays are sources of ionizing radiation potentially dangerous to the human body. To quantify the dose of radiation received, the sievert is used, defined as the unit of energy received per unit of mass. Exposure to radiation from cosmic rays increases with altitude, which can pose a problem for aircraft crews. Recently, accurate measurements of ionizing radiation doses were taken for flights between Rio de Janeiro and Rome. The results have indicated that the average dose of radiation received during the cruise phase (which usually represents 80 percent of the total flight time) of this intercontinental route is 2 microsieverts per hour. International civil aviation standards limit the working time for crews operating on intercontinental flights to 1,000 hours per year. Consider that the dose of ionizing radiation for a chest X-ray is estimated at 0.2 millisieverts. []",How many chest X-rays does the dose of ionizing radiation to which a crew member operating on the Rio de Janeiro-Rome route is exposed over a year correspond to?,"{'A': '8', 'B': '10', 'C': '80', 'D': '100', 'E': '1 000'}",{'A': '8'},,,,,,,No,False,True,[],,NATURAL SCIENCES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,ORANGE,,"To calculate the total dose of ionizing radiation for a crew member operating on the Rio de Janeiro-Rome route, we first find the dose per hour (2 microsieverts) and then multiply it by the total flight time per year (1,000 hours).

As the dose of ionizing radiation for a chest X-ray is 0.2 millisieverts, the total number of chest X-rays equivalent to the dose is 2 millisieverts / 0.2 millisieverts per X-ray = 10 chest X-rays.

In the beginning was the Word. The sentence that opens the first chapter of the Gospel of John and refers to the creation of the world, as Genesis also does, is the most famous in the Bible. The idea that the world is created by the word, however, is so structuring that it is present in other religions, far beyond those founded in Christianity. As humans, language is the world we inhabit. Just try to imagine a world where we cannot use words to talk about ourselves and others to understand what that means. Or a world where what you say is not understood by others, and what others say is not understood by you.
