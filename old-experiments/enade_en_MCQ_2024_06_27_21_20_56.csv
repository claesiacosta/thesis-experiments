Representative democracy requires, for its functioning, a set of characteristics, which can be understood as institutions. They are: Elected officials; Free, fair and frequent elections; Inclusive suffrage; Right to run for elective office; Freedom of expression; Diversified sources of information; Autonomy for associations. Among the mentioned categories, two stand out as pillars of the democratic regime.
Freedom of expression: citizens have the right to express themselves, without the danger of severe punishments, regarding political matters in general, which includes the freedom to criticize government officials, the government itself, the regime, the socioeconomic order, and the dominant ideology.
Diversified sources of information: citizens have the right to seek alternative, diversified, and independent sources of information. Furthermore, the existence of alternative sources of information must be protected by law.

Although political regimes can be overthrown and ideologies criticized and stripped of their legitimacy, behind a regime and its ideology there is always a way of thinking and feeling, a series of cultural habits, a nebula of obscure instincts and unfathomable impulses.

They contribute to containing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting biodiversity, and enhancing systems.
If the Temporal Framework criterion is maintained, the land conflict may intensify.

Photo of Charles Humpres showing graffiti by Eduardo Kobra. The art occupies the side space of two floors of a building, characterized by the intense use of contrasts and colors that portrays a man sitting on the ground, head down, barefoot, with two empty plates by his side and holding a sign that reads 'Welcome to real Brazil'.
Initially, the transgressive nature of graffiti was seen by the State as vandalism in public space and as a danger to the conservation of private property, therefore, it should be combated. Over time, however, this marginal conception has transformed, leading to an acceptable valorization by the State and positive for society. This transition of graffiti, from marginal art to recognized and accepted artistic expression, has revealed important aspects not only for graffiti professionals, but for society as a whole, as it incorporates the possibility of being an artistic product of cultural, economic, and ideological value.

10,Administration,2022,"Among the theories used in Administration, Mathematical Theory is the one that focuses on rational decision-making process, based on mathematical, statistical, and computational procedures. This theory emerged between the 1940s and 1950s and has been present in managerial practices and trends since then. Game theory, queuing theory, probability theory, and linear programming, applied to managerial problems, are techniques and methods recurring in mathematical sciences that originated from Mathematical Theory. The recent evolution of the use of Mathematical Theory is evidenced in the methods and processes of Big Data, Business Intelligence, and Business Analytics, which use computational platforms with large volumes of data in different formats (numeric, textual, visual). When considering the different specialties and managerial functions, there are variations in the intensity of use of these tools, in areas that make intensive use of methods and tools, and in others that have reduced use. In addition, functional areas are linked, in a differentiated way, to different methods. Source of the Text: ANDRADE, R .; AMBONI, N.

Competitive Advantage is subdivided into: Lower Cost and Differentiation. From the relationships between the four variables we will have: • From the meeting of Lower Cost and Broad Target, we have 1. Cost Leadership; • From the meeting of Differentiation and Broad Target, we have 2. Differentiation; • From the meeting of Lower Cost and Narrow Target, we have 3A.

The binomial 'innovative idea + technology' is not the unequivocal key to success, why? The key issue is the 'business model', which can be translated as the element that connects what technology provides and what the market wants. A new technology that does not have a specific business model must know how to extract value from technological innovation. Therefore, the entrepreneur needs to structure his business model well, understanding how various resources interact, often in a complex way, and how the company can create and capture value from this interaction. In the tourism segment, for example, many people do not have the expertise or time to consult hotels on the internet or to enter a flight search site. For them, it is better to go to an agency. Innovative business models that have emerged in this segment have modified the market structure, and past travel agencies whose business core was the average customer have fallen by the wayside. With this, new business models focused on specific niches (for example, popular tourism) or customized products (for example, Safari in Namibia) have emerged.

34,Administration,2022,"Faced with the difficulties of evaluating staff performance during the period of social isolation due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it was recommended to adapt a widely used measure in Marketing for the area of People Management. The proposal was to use what they called 'Net Performance Promoters Score (NPPS)' or 'Net Performance Promoters Score (ELPD)', with evaluation based on three questions for each worker/employee: 1) What is the likelihood that you would recommend this organization as a workplace to friends or relatives?, with responses restricted to a 10-point scale, with extremes of 1 (indicating very unlikely) and 10 (indicating very likely); 2) Why did you indicate this score?, with an open-ended response; 3) What could be done for you to increase your score by 1 point?, with an open-ended response. Regarding the first question, respondents who indicated from 1 to 6 would be categorized as 'detractors', those who indicated 9 or 10 would be categorized as 'promoters', and the others would be categorized as 'passives'. The ELPD is defined as the difference between the percentage of promoters and the percentage of detractors. According to the proposal, it is a convenient, practical, relevant, and useful metric for measuring staff performance in times of crisis, and it may be useful after the end of the pandemic.

35,Administration,2022,"One of the main factors for organizational success today is the adoption of situational leadership. Situational leadership is understood as being based on adapting the way of leading, taking as a parameter the context in which the company and the team are. In situational leadership, changes are implemented in such a way that it is possible to promote motivation, productivity, and team engagement, which has an impact on business results. For most companies, leadership that recognizes and values individual merit is highly recommended. Some decades ago, many managers were uncompromising autocrats, who gave orders and showed little concern for those who were hierarchically below them. Over the years, this style of leadership has given way to more sensitive and effective approaches, and there is solid evidence that employees find these styles much more motivating. To maintain a sense of balance, leaders must meet the emotional needs of their employees, helping them realize that they are part of something important and communicating appreciation, concern, and support.

Representative democracy requires, for its functioning, a set of characteristics, which can be understood as institutions. They are: Elected officials; Free, fair and frequent elections; Inclusive suffrage; Right to run for elective office; Freedom of expression; Diversified sources of information; Autonomy for associations. Among the mentioned categories, two stand out as pillars of the democratic regime.
Freedom of expression: citizens have the right to express themselves, without the danger of severe punishments, regarding political matters in general, which includes the freedom to criticize government officials, the government itself, the regime, the socioeconomic order, and the dominant ideology.
Diversified sources of information: citizens have the right to seek alternative, diversified, and independent sources of information. Furthermore, the existence of alternative sources of information must be protected by law.

Photo of Charles Humpres showing graffiti by Eduardo Kobra. The art occupies the side space of two floors of a building, characterized by the intense use of contrasts and colors that portrays a man sitting on the ground, head down, barefoot, with two empty plates by his side and holding a sign that reads 'Welcome to real Brazil'.
Initially, the transgressive nature of graffiti was seen by the State as vandalism in public space and as a danger to the conservation of private property, therefore, it should be combated. Over time, however, this marginal conception has transformed, leading to an acceptable valorization by the State and positive for society. This transition of graffiti, from marginal art to recognized and accepted artistic expression, has revealed important aspects not only for graffiti professionals, but for society as a whole, as it incorporates the possibility of being an artistic product of cultural, economic, and ideological value.

On June 20, 2022, the news website The Intercept Brazil, in partnership with the portal Catarinas, published a story denouncing that an 11-year-old girl, pregnant after being a victim of rape, had been kept by the Justice of Santa Catarina in a shelter for over a month, in order to prevent her from having a legal abortion. According to the story, published using text and video, the girl was taken to the hospital by her mother to undergo the procedure two days after the pregnancy was discovered. Although the Penal Code allows abortion in cases of sexual violence, the medical team refused to perform the procedure. The girl was then sent to the shelter by the court, under the justification that there was a risk that the mother would take some action to end the baby's life. The report shows video excerpts of the victim's mother's testimony (image below) and the girl herself. The case had wide media coverage and the same excerpts of the testimonies were reproduced on several newscasts.

In 2009, the Statute was amended to include privacy among the specific measures for the protection of children and adolescents.

Since the modern period, photographs have been the subject of discussion about the exposure of suffering. This reflection has been developed around images that present various situations of catastrophes, wars, attacks, diseases, and accidents. If, on one hand, photographic images in mass media emerge as records of daily misfortunes and woes, on the other hand, the ethical implications of photojournalistic practice have shed light on the creation of a large gallery of sufferers transformed into examples of various themes that make up ordinary sufferings. This has been the target of criticism focused on both the exploitation of others' misfortunes and the critical and affective numbness of viewers stimulated by this torrent of images of suffering. However, photojournalism still plays an important role in the ways of perceiving the realities of the world, configuring itself as a complex field of visibility in which various pacts of access and distribution of places between bodies and speeches operate.

Representative democracy requires, for its functioning, a set of characteristics, which can be understood as institutions. They are: Elected officials; Free, fair and frequent elections; Inclusive suffrage; Right to run for elective office; Freedom of expression; Diversified sources of information; Autonomy for associations. Among the mentioned categories, two stand out as pillars of the democratic regime.
Freedom of expression: citizens have the right to express themselves, without the danger of severe punishments, regarding political matters in general, which includes the freedom to criticize government officials, the government itself, the regime, the socioeconomic order, and the dominant ideology.
Diversified sources of information: citizens have the right to seek alternative, diversified, and independent sources of information. Furthermore, the existence of alternative sources of information must be protected by law.

Research results from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), linked to the United Nations (UN), indicate that, in addition to intimate femicide, perpetrated by partners or ex-partners of the victim, and systemic sexual femicide, where the victim is kidnapped and raped, there is lesbophobic or biphobic femicide, configured when the victim is bisexual or lesbian and is murdered because the aggressor believes she should be punished for her sexual orientation.

Photo of Charles Humpres showing Eduardo Kobra's graffiti. The art occupies the side space of two floors of a building, characterized by the intense use of contrasts and colors depicting a man sitting on the ground, head down, barefoot, with two empty plates beside him and holding a sign that reads 'Welcome to real Brazil'.
Initially, the transgressive nature of graffiti was seen by the State as vandalism in public space and as a danger to the conservation of private property, therefore, it should be combated. Over time, however, this marginal conception has transformed, leading to an acceptable valorization by the State and positive for society. This transition of graffiti, from marginal art to recognized and accepted artistic expression, has revealed important aspects not only for graffiti professionals but for society as a whole, as it incorporates the possibility of being an artistic product of cultural, economic, and ideological value.

Constitutional supremacy translates into formal and material superlegality. Formal superlegality identifies the Constitution as the primary source of normative production, dictating competences and procedures for the elaboration of lower normative acts. And material superlegality subordinates the content of all state normative activity to conformity with the principles and rules of the Constitution. The non-compliance with these formal and material prescriptions triggers a mechanism for protecting the Constitution, known among us as constitutional review.

13,Law,2022,"Between Tax Law and Economics there is a natural and necessary connection, since the State is the main responsible for economic regulation. Therefore, it is imperative for it to create mechanisms that point out to society and the market the economic model it has adopted. In this sense, Tax Law, in its extrafiscal function, seems to be the ideal tool to guide the taxpayer through the economic paths chosen by the State. It is said to be in its extrafiscal function because tax norms can also assume a fiscal and parafiscal function.
As observed, extrafiscality acts in a way to 'induce' the economic agent to behave as it seems desirable to the State. In this aspect, it has long been realized that tax law is better obeyed when, instead of determining behaviors, it uses the most subtle way to influence them, granting taxpayers subsidies, exemptions, presumed credits, bonuses, etc. With such artifice, people feel free to conduct their business and tend to do what the Nation expects of them.

The state's power to tax cannot disregard the fundamental rights of the citizen. In fact, the taxing power is legitimized and affirmed by respecting the rights of freedom and the constitutional principles linked to security, justice, and equality.
In this line of thought, in search of better tax justice, it is necessary to pay attention to the contributive capacity. To achieve this goal, tax benefits are sometimes used to mitigate the tax burden. In these cases, it can be considered, at first, that this was done to achieve higher purposes. The tax obligation cannot arise where contributive capacity is lacking. This capacity constitutes a requirement for personalization of the tax. Ethical taxation must be guided by respect for contributive capacity and the minimum existential necessary for survival.

Among these structuring norms, the principle of minimum intervention stands out, born from the Enlightenment ideals, which recognizes that punishment is an 'imperfect solution' for the protection of relevant legal goods, because it itself violates a category of this good - freedom - preventing the primary action of punitive power in defense of these interests. Therefore, the manifestation of punitive power is only legitimate when other forms of social control prove incapable of safeguarding serious disturbances to the legal order.

18,Law,2022,"Social and environmentally responsible management has been a recurring theme in the business environment when discussing economic development. The great challenge for companies is to develop sustainable activities and make profits while maintaining competitiveness.
Aiming to understand the impact of a culture of sustainability on the behavior and performance of companies, a department at Harvard University in the United States published the result of a scientific investigation after analyzing the economic life of 180 companies over a period of 18 years (from 1994 to 2012). It was found that sustainable companies generated much more profit than those that did not observe sustainability. According to the researchers, the profitability of sustainable companies resulted from the adoption of conscious and organized management.

The integrity of the environment cannot be compromised by individual interests, just as strict liability, in the environmental field, guided by the principles of polluter-pays and full reparation, cannot be eluded by the application of the de minimis principle. The jurisprudence of the Superior Court of Justice and the Federal Supreme Court is firm in not allowing the prevalence of defense theses in environmental law that, through oblique means, seek to protect alleged acquired rights to deforestation, nor admit the invocation of the theory of fait accompli as a way to exempt the offender from the duty to promote the recovery of the area affected by human intervention. Otherwise, it would be endorsing that the fundamental, non-negotiable, and intergenerational right to a balanced environment, constitutionally enshrined in Article 225 of the Federal Constitution, could be subjugated to selfish claims. The refusal or partial application of the polluter-pays and full reparation principles risks projecting, morally, the harmful impression that environmental wrongdoing pays off. Therefore, the judicial response, in the case of environmental damage, must be vigorous, under penalty of the offender's impunity serving as social inspiration.

However, this threefold approach was not implemented in Brazil, due to the political choice adopted by the military regime, enshrined in the Amnesty Law (Law 6.683/1979), based on the ideals of forgiveness and forgetting. When judging the Direct Action of Unconstitutionality (ADPF) No. 153 in 2010, the Federal Supreme Court analyzed the constitutionality of the Amnesty Law in light of the 1988 Federal Constitution and expressed the understanding that the decision to enact the Amnesty Law stems from the state sovereignty of the country and, therefore, Brazil would not be obliged to revise it. In 2010, Brazil was condemned by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in the Gomes Lund case, which carried out the control of conventionality between the Brazilian Amnesty Law and the American Convention on Human Rights, in order to prevent the application of amnesty to crimes against humanity committed by public agents during the military regime. In 2018, Brazil was again condemned by the Inter-American Court for the deprivation of liberty, torture, and murder of journalist Vladimir Herzog within the premises of the Brazilian State body responsible for investigating citizens opposed to the regime.

Representative democracy requires, for its functioning, a set of characteristics, which can be understood as institutions. They are: Elected officials; Free, fair and frequent elections; Inclusive suffrage; Right to run for elective office; Freedom of expression; Diversified sources of information; Autonomy for associations. Among the mentioned categories, two stand out as pillars of the democratic regime.
Freedom of expression: citizens have the right to express themselves, without the danger of severe punishments, regarding political matters in general, which includes the freedom to criticize government officials, the government itself, the regime, the socioeconomic order, and the dominant ideology.
Diversified sources of information: citizens have the right to seek alternative, diversified, and independent sources of information. Furthermore, the existence of alternative sources of information must be protected by law.

Although political regimes can be overthrown and ideologies criticized and stripped of their legitimacy, behind a regime and its ideology there is always a way of thinking and feeling, a series of cultural habits, a nebula of obscure instincts and unfathomable impulses.

They contribute to containing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting biodiversity, and enhancing systems.
If the Temporal Framework criterion is maintained, the land war could be intensified.

Photo of Charles Humpres showing graffiti by Eduardo Kobra. The art occupies the side space of two floors of a building, characterized by the intense use of contrasts and colors depicting a man sitting on the ground, head down, barefoot, with two empty plates beside him and holding a sign that reads 'Welcome to real Brazil'.
Initially, the transgressive nature of graffiti was seen by the State as vandalism in public space and as a danger to the conservation of private property, therefore, it should be combated. Over time, however, this marginal conception has transformed, leading to an acceptable valorization by the State and positive for society. This transition of graffiti, from marginal art to recognized and accepted artistic expression, has revealed important aspects not only for graffiti professionals but for society as a whole, as it incorporates the possibility of being an artistic product of cultural, economic, and ideological value.

In May 2022, Genivaldo de Jesus Santos was suffocated and killed by tear gas, according to the Forensic Medical Institute report, inside a Federal Highway Police vehicle in the state of Sergipe, after being approached for riding a motorcycle without a helmet. During the police approach, a nephew of the victim informed that he suffered from schizophrenia, had been in treatment for about 20 years, and was taking medication, which, in fact, was in his possession. Even though the police were informed, the approach continued with the use of force and violence, disproportionate to the risk posed by Genivaldo.

TEXT 2
At the beginning of the 20th century, the first eugenic initiatives emerged in the country, whose collective problems were understood from the unwanted proliferation of people who reproduced, over consecutive generations, spreading vicious, criminal, and degenerate behavioral and mental characteristics. Under the altruistic discourse of guaranteeing treatment, the insane-criminal came to be contained and isolated in judicial asylums, institutions linked to the prison system and administered, at the time, by important psychiatrists.
