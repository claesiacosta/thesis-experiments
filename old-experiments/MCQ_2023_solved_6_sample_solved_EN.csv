Dear Citizens,
The aging population is a worldwide phenomenon. Unfortunately, our country is not yet prepared to meet the demands of this population.
This is the picture of public health in Brazil, which, despite undeniable advances, presents a scenario of deficiencies and lack of integration at all levels of health care: primary (poor care in basic health units), secondary (lack of reference centers with specialist care) and tertiary (hospital care focused on the disease in the elderly), that is, there is no, in practice, a health care network for the elderly.
Faced with this scenario, the Brazilian Society of Geriatrics and Gerontology (SBGG) publicly expresses its concerns about the present and future of the elderly in Brazil. Health must be guaranteed as a universal right.
We hope that both our current and future leaders and legislators reflect on the need to invest in health and quality of life associated with aging. Dignity for the health of the elderly!

If he wasn't a criminal, he would become one day

The stanza above is from the poet and social educator Baticum Proletário, who works in the outskirts of Fortaleza, in Ceará, preparing young people - mostly black - to face the difficulties imposed by structural racism in the country.
It is through art that Baticum manages to engage youth in a project to strengthen this population by promoting rhyme battles, slams, and gatherings with themes that discuss social problems. Not surprisingly, the most explored theme in rhymes, verses, and prose is violence. According to the most recent Violence Atlas, in 2019, blacks accounted for 77 percent of homicide victims, almost 30 murders per 100,000 inhabitants, most of them young.
The Atlas also reveals that a black person is almost 2.7 times more likely to be killed than a white person, justifying the growing resistance movement in Brazil.

The stanza above is from the poet and social educator Baticum Proletário, who works in the outskirts of Fortaleza, in Ceará, preparing young people - mostly black - to face the difficulties imposed by structural racism in the country.
It is through art that Baticum manages to engage youth in a project to strengthen this population by promoting rhyme battles, slams, and gatherings with themes that discuss social problems. Not surprisingly, the most explored theme in rhymes, verses, and prose is violence. According to the most recent Violence Atlas, in 2019, blacks accounted for 77 percent of homicide victims, almost 30 murders per 100,000 inhabitants, most of them young.
The Atlas also reveals that a black person is almost 2.7 times more likely to be killed than a white person, justifying the growing resistance movement in Brazil.

A small Brazilian publisher, Urutau, has just launched in Lisbon an 'anti-racist anthology of foreign poets in Portugal', entitled Return to your land.
The book denounces the various forms of racism to which immigrants are subjected. Some of the anthologized Brazilian poets complain about the disdain with which a large number of Portuguese people welcome Brazilian Portuguese. It is a common complaint.
'Here in Portugal they say / - they say - / that our Portuguese is wrong, that we do not speak Portuguese,' writes the São Paulo poet Maria Giulia Pinheiro, to conclude: 'If your language, the Lusitanian one, / still preserves the word of oppression / it is not the most beautiful in the world. / It is one of the most violent.'

Silk, aromatic woods and textiles, works of art, wool, crystals and many, many pieces of porcelain arrived in Brazil during the 17th and 18th centuries. The opulence provided by gold made these items even more present in mining cities such as Ouro Preto, Mariana and Sabará. These objects inspired the creation of chinesices, a term that designates a type of art that evokes Chinese motifs, present in several baroque churches in Minas Gerais. In Brazil, it is very likely that the inspiration for the paintings in the baroque churches with birds, elephants, tigers, mandarins and pagodas was taken from engravings, fabrics, furniture and, mainly, from the Chinese porcelains that freely circulated in a society enriched by the trade of gold and gemstones.

NATURAL SCIENCES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"## The aircraft crew member and ionizing radiation
Cosmic rays are sources of potentially dangerous ionizing radiation for the human body. To quantify the dose of radiation received, the sievert is used, defined as the unit of energy received per unit of mass. Exposure to radiation from cosmic rays increases with altitude, which can pose a problem for aircraft crews. Recently, accurate measurements of ionizing radiation doses were taken for flights between Rio de Janeiro and Rome. The results have indicated that the average dose of radiation received during the cruise phase (which usually represents 80 percent of the total flight time) of this intercontinental route is 2 microsieverts per hour. International civil aviation standards limit the working time for crews on intercontinental flights to 1,000 hours per year.
