Master and companion, I said we were going to say goodbye. But I said it wrong. Death does not extinguish: it transforms; it does not annihilate: it renews; it does not divorce: it brings closer. One day you supposed the consort of your dreams and agonies, who had managed to 'put a whole world in the corner' of your nest, 'dead and separated'; and yet, she was never more present to you, in the depths of yourself and in the expression of your song, in the depths of your being and in the face of your actions. These fourteen inimitable verses, in which the rapture of your disciples summarizes the value of a whole literature, were the golden alliance of your second engagement, a ring of other nuptials, for the new life of your rebirth and glorification, with the partner without blemish of your years of youth and maturity, of the flowering and fruiting of your soul. For the chosen ones of the world of ideas, misery lies in decadence, not in death. The nobility of one preserves us from the ruins of the other.

Dear Citizens,
The aging population is a worldwide phenomenon. Unfortunately, our country is not yet prepared to meet the demands of this population.
This is the picture of public health in Brazil, which, despite undeniable advances, presents a scenario of deficiencies and lack of integration at all levels of health care: primary (poor care in basic health units), secondary (lack of reference centers with specialist care) and tertiary (hospital care focused on the disease in the elderly), that is, there is no, in practice, a health care network for the elderly.
Faced with this scenario, the Brazilian Society of Geriatrics and Gerontology (SBGG) publicly expresses its concerns about the present and future of the elderly in Brazil. Health must be guaranteed as a universal right.
We hope that both our current and future rulers and legislators reflect on the need to invest in health and quality of life associated with aging. Dignity for the health of the elderly!

While we were entertained by the vultures, other things were happening in the city. The Company imposed new prohibitions, some entirely silly, just for the pleasure of prohibiting (no one could spit upwards, or carry water in a gourd, or cover the sun with a sieve, as if everyone was abusing these oddities); but others were quite annoying, such as jumping over walls to take a shortcut, a tactic that almost everyone who didn't suffer from rheumatism had been adopting lately, especially the boys. And not trusting only in the prohibition, nor in the strength of the punishments, which were strict, the Company even ordered to embed glass shards in the walls. I found that to be an exaggeration, and commented on the matter with my mother. My father overheard from the room and came to explain. He said that in normal times one thing or another was enough; but now the Company could not admit any loophole in its orders; if someone disobeyed the prohibition they could cut themselves on the shards; if someone managed to jump over a wall by breaking the cut of some shards, or throwing a leather over it, they were caught by the prohibition, nhoc — and made the gesture of twisting a chicken's neck.

In the beginning was the Word. The sentence that opens the first chapter of the Gospel of John and refers to the creation of the world, as Genesis also does, is the most famous in the Bible. The idea that the world is created by the word, however, is so structuring that it is present in other religions, far beyond those founded in Christianity. As humans, language is the world we inhabit. Just try to imagine a world where we cannot use words to talk about ourselves and others to understand what that means. Or a world in which what you say is not understood by others, and what others say is not understood by you.
What happens then when the word is destroyed and, with it, language?
For centuries, in different societies and languages, it is important to remember, language has served — and still serves — to maintain privileges of powerful groups and leave everyone else out. Who understands the language of lawyers, judges, and prosecutors, the language of doctors, the language of bureaucrats, the language of scientists? Most of the population has been subjected to the violence of being deliberately prevented from understanding the language of those who determine their destinies.

The pessimist
Gabriel García Márquez
Gerineldo sleeps because he is already resigned to his world. Because he already knows everything that can happen to him after subjecting all the objects around him to a meticulous inventory of possibilities. His apartment, more than an apartment, is a theory of luck and misfortune. Better than anyone, Gerineldo knows the coefficient of expansion of his windows and keeps marked on the thermometer, with a red line, the point at which the glass will break, shattered into shards of death. He knows that architects and engineers have already predicted everything, except what has never happened before.

Being and Nothingness: An Essay on Phenomenological Ontology
Jean-Paul Sartre
The situation is the whole subject (he is nothing but his situation) and is also the whole thing (there is never anything but things). It is the subject elucidating things by its own overcoming, if we wish; or it is the things sending back to the subject his image. It is total facticity, the absolute contingency of the world, of my birth, of my place, of my past, of my surroundings - and it is my limitless freedom that makes facticity exist for me.

During the French Revolution, a certain priest Niollant hid in the small castle of L’Escarbas. He paid generously for the hospitality of the old nobleman by taking care of his daughter's education, Anaïs. The presence of the mother did not change this masculine education given to a young creature already very inclined to independence by virtue of life in the countryside. The priest passed on to the student his fearlessness of opinions and his ease of judgment, without thinking that these qualities, so necessary in a man, become defects in a woman destined for the humble tasks of a family mother.

The Jewish presence in Brazil gradually created certain suspicions that were reflected in press organs and in intellectual and political circles. In part, this negative image would stem from the nationalist wave that emerged in the late 1910s, which conceived immigrants as competitors of Brazilian workers, or as unproductive beings, exploiters of labor and native wealth.

Down syndrome is a genetic alteration associated with trisomy of chromosome 21, that is, the individual has three chromosome 21 instead of a pair, as is normal. This occurs due to the union of a gamete containing one chromosome 21 with a gamete containing two chromosome 21. Although, normally, women with the syndrome are sterile, in 2008, in the countryside of São Paulo, one of them gave birth to a girl without Down syndrome.

This is done based on the relationship between the remaining carbon-14 in the fossil and the amount of carbon-14 in a similar current species. Despite undergoing radioactive decay, the amount of carbon-14 in the atmosphere, particularly in CO2 molecules, is practically constant, due to the incidence of cosmic rays constantly hitting the Earth. Thus, as part of the carbon cycle, animals and plants maintain a practically constant amount of carbon-14 in their constitution while they are alive. However, when they die, the entry of carbon into the organism ceases and this number decreases as carbon-14 decays radioactively.

The high temperature causes the vaporization of all the contents inside this type of container, increasing the pressure inside it until the packaging explodes.

112,2023,"## The aircraft crew member and ionizing radiation
Cosmic rays are sources of potentially dangerous ionizing radiation for the human body. To quantify the dose of radiation received, the sievert is used, defined as the unit of energy received per unit of mass. Exposure to radiation from cosmic rays increases with altitude, which can pose a problem for aircraft crews. Recently, accurate measurements of ionizing radiation doses were taken for flights between Rio de Janeiro and Rome. The results have indicated that the average dose of radiation received during the cruise phase (which usually represents 80 percent of the total flight time) of this intercontinental route is 2 microsieverts per hour. International civil aviation standards limit the working time for crews operating on intercontinental flights to 1,000 hours per year.

Since the dose of ionizing radiation for a chest X-ray is 0.2 millisieverts, we divide the total dose by the dose per chest X-ray (2 millisieverts / 0.2 millisieverts = 10).
