A common fact when cooking rice is the 
spilling of part of the cooking water over the 
blue flame of the fire, changing it to a yellow flame. 
This color change can raise various interpretations, related to the substances present in the cooking water. In addition to kitchen salt (NaCl), it contains carbohydrates, proteins, and mineral salts.

Researchers have created a type of artificial platelet, 
made of a gelatinous polymer covered with antibodies, 
which promises to speed up the coagulation process when 
injected into the body. If there is bleeding, these 
antibodies cause the platelet to change its shape 
and transform into a kind of network that sticks to 
lesions in blood vessels and skin.

The carbon-14 technique allows the dating of fossils by measuring the beta emission values of this isotope present in the fossil. For a living being, the maximum is 15 beta emissions/(min g). After death, the amount of 14C
is reduced by half every 5,730 years.

A major turning point in modern agricultural history occurred after World War II. After the war, 
governments were faced with a huge surplus of ammonium nitrate, an ingredient used in the manufacture 
of explosives. From then on, ammunition factories were adapted to start producing fertilizers with 
nitrates as the main component.

Researchers were able to stimulate the absorption of 
light energy in plants thanks to the use of carbon 
nanotubes. For this, carbon nanotubes 'inserted' into the interior of chloroplasts through a spontaneous assembly, through the membranes of the chloroplasts. Plant pigments absorb light radiation, electrons are 'excited' and move within the chloroplast membranes, and the plant then uses this electrical energy to produce sugars. Carbon nanotubes can absorb wavelengths usually not used by chloroplasts, and researchers had the idea of using them as 'antennas', stimulating the conversion of solar energy by chloroplasts, with increased electron transport.

Carbon nanotubes enhance plant photosynthesis.

The phenomenon of the spawning (river ascent) is an important mechanism that influences the reproduction of some fish species, as it induces the process that stimulates fat burning and activates complex hormonal mechanisms, preparing them for reproduction. Anthropogenic interventions in aquatic environments, such as the construction of dams, interfere with the reproduction of these animals.

The gray dolphins (Sotalia guianensis), mammals of the 
dolphin family, are excellent indicators of 
pollution in the areas where they live, as they spend 
their entire life - about 30 years - in the same region. In addition, the species accumulates more contaminants in its 
body, such as mercury, than other animals in its 
food chain.

The iron is found in nature in the form of its ores, such as hematite (a-Fe2O3), magnetite (Fe3O4)
and wustite (FeO). In metallurgy, pig iron is obtained by melting iron ores in blast furnaces under suitable conditions. One of the steps in this process is the formation of carbon monoxide. CO (gaseous) is used to reduce FeO (solid), according to the chemical equation:

The Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a disease 
caused by a mutation in a gene located on the 
X chromosome. Researchers studied a family 
in which monozygotic twins were carriers of a 
recessive mutant allele for this gene (heterozygous). 
The interesting fact is that one of the twins had 
the phenotype related to the mutant allele, that is, DMD, 
while her sister had a normal phenotype.

Some types of desalination plants use the process of 
reverse osmosis to obtain drinking water from 
saltwater. In this method, a container is used 
containing two compartments separated by a 
semipermeable membrane: in one of them saltwater is placed 
and in the other drinking water is collected. The application 
of mechanical pressure on the system causes the water to flow from one 
compartment to the other. The movement of water molecules 
through the membrane is controlled by osmotic pressure and the applied mechanical pressure.

To demonstrate the process of transforming mechanical energy into electrical energy, a student builds a small generator using:

• a copper wire with diameter D wound in N circular turns of area A;

• two magnets that create a uniform magnetic field of intensity B in the space between them; and

• a gear system that allows him to rotate the turns around an axis with a frequency f.

When the generator is operational, the student obtained a maximum voltage V and a short-circuit current i.",,"{

In the air we breathe there are the so-called 'inert gases'. They bring curious Greek names, which mean 'the New', 'the Hidden', 'the Inactive'. And indeed they are so inert, so satisfied in their condition, that they do not interfere in any chemical reaction, do not combine with any other element and precisely for this reason they remained unnoticed for centuries: only in 1962 a chemist, after long and ingenious efforts, managed to force 'the Stranger' (xenon) to fleetingly combine with the eager and lively fluorine, and the feat seemed so extraordinary that he was awarded the Nobel Prize.

The retina is a light-sensitive tissue, located in the back of the eye, where the image formation process occurs. In this tissue, several specific types of cells are found. One of these cell types is the cones, which convert different wavelengths of visible light into electrical signals, which are transmitted by the optic nerve to the brain.

In a cafeteria, the best-selling products in the summer are juices 
prepared with fruit pulp. One of the most sold juices is the strawberry with acerola, which is prepared with <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mfrac><mn>2</mn><mn>3</mn></mfrac></math> of strawberry pulp and <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>3</mn></mfrac></math> of acerola pulp.

For the merchant, the pulps are sold in 
packagings of equal volume. Currently, the packaging 
of strawberry pulp costs R$ 18.00 and acerola, 
R$ 14.70. However, there is a forecasted increase in the price 
of the acerola pulp packaging next month, 
increasing to R$ 15.30.

In order not to increase the price of the juice, the merchant 
negotiated with the supplier a reduction in the price of 
the strawberry pulp packaging.

A couple is moving to a new home and needs to pack a cubic object with 80 cm edges into a cardboard box that cannot be disassembled. They have five boxes available, with different dimensions, as described:

• Box 1: 86 cm × 86 cm × 86 cm
• Box 2: 75 cm × 82 cm × 90 cm
• Box 3: 85 cm × 82 cm × 90 cm
• Box 4: 82 cm × 95 cm × 82 cm

At 17 h 15 min a heavy rain begins to fall with constant intensity. A rectangular parallelepiped-shaped pool, which was initially empty, starts to collect rainwater and, at 18 hours, the water level inside reaches a height of 20 cm. At that moment, the drain valve located at the bottom of the pool is opened, allowing the water to flow out at a constant rate. At 18 h 40 min the rain stops, and at that exact moment, the water level in the pool drops to 15 cm.

162,MATHEMATICS AND ITS TECHNOLOGIES,2017,"The message typed on the cell phone, while you drive, takes your attention away and, therefore, should be avoided. Research shows that a driver who drives a car at a constant speed travels 'blindly' (that is, without seeing the road) a distance proportional to the time spent looking at the cell phone while typing the message. Consider that this actually happens. Suppose that two drivers (X and Y) drive at the same constant speed and type the same message on their cell phones. Suppose, furthermore, that the time spent by driver X looking at his cell phone while typing the message corresponds to 25% of the time spent by driver Y to perform the same task.",,"{

For a season of Formula 1 races, the fuel tank capacity of each car became 100 kg of gasoline. A team chose to use gasoline with a density of 750 grams per liter, starting the race with a full tank. At the first refueling stop, a car from this team showed a record on its onboard computer indicating the consumption of four tenths of the gasoline originally in the tank. To minimize the weight of this car and ensure the end of the race, the support team refueled the car with one third of what was left in the tank upon arrival at the refueling station.

The solar energy will supply part of the energy demand 
of the campus of a Brazilian university. The installation of 
solar panels in the parking areas and on the roof 
of the pediatric hospital will be used in the university facilities 
and also connected to the grid of the electricity distribution company.

The project includes 100 m² of solar panels that will be 
installed in the parking areas, producing electrical energy 
and providing shade for the cars. About the pediatric hospital 
approximately 300 m² of panels will be installed, with 100 m² for generating electrical energy used on the 
campus, and 200 m² for thermal energy generation, producing 
water heating used in the hospital boilers.

Suppose that each square meter of solar panel 
for electrical energy generates a saving of 1 kWh per day 
and each square meter producing thermal energy allows 
saving 0.7 kWh per day for the university. In 
a second phase of the project, the area 
covered by the solar panels generating 
electrical energy will be increased by 75%. In this phase, the area 
of coverage with panels for thermal energy generation should also be expanded.

PROPAGANDA - The examination of texts and messages 
from Propaganda reveals that it presents partial positions, 
reflecting only the thoughts of a minority, as if they expressed, instead, the conviction of a population; it is, in essence, to convince the listener or reader that, in terms of opinion, they are off the right path, and to induce them to adhere to the theses presented to them, through a well-known mechanism of social psychology, that of conformity induced by group pressures on the isolated individual.

Romans used social networks two thousand years ago, says book

When tweeting or commenting below the post of one of your 
several friends on Facebook, you probably feel 
privileged to live in a time in history when it is 
possible to immediately reach a vast network of 
contacts through a simple click on the 'send' button. 
You may also reflect on how past generations 
could live without social media, devoid 
of the ability to see and be seen, to receive, generate 
and interact with a huge amount of information. But what 
you may not know is that humans have been using 
social interaction tools for over two thousand years. 
This is what Tom Standage, author of the book Writing on the 
Wall - Social Media, The first 2 000 Years, claims.

According to Standage, Marcus Tullius Cicero, Roman philosopher and 
politician, would have been, along with other members of the 
Roman elite, a precursor in the use of social networks. The author 
recounts how Cicero used a slave, who later 
became his scribe, to write messages on scrolls 
of papyrus that were sent to a kind of network of 
contacts. These people, in turn, copied his text, 
added their own comments and passed it on. 'Today we have computers and broadband, but the 
Romans had slaves and scribes who transmitted their 
messages,' Standage told BBC Brazil. 'Members 
of the Roman elite constantly wrote to each other, 
commenting on the latest political movements and 
expressing opinions.'

In addition to papyrus, another platform commonly used 
by the Romans was a wax tablet the size and shape of a 
modern tablet, on which they wrote messages, 
questions or transmitted the main points of the acta
diurna, a 'newspaper' displayed daily in the Forum of 
Rome. This tablet, the 'Ancient Rome iPad', was taken 
by a messenger to the recipient, who replied 
below the message.

Texts and hypertexts: seeking balance
There is a fear on the part of parents and some teachers that children will unlearn when browsing, fear of them becoming addicted, of obtaining unreliable information, of isolating themselves from the real world, as if the computer were an agent of evil, a villain. This fear is reinforced by the media, which usually presents the computer as a negative agent in learning and in the socialization of users. We know that no one is at risk of unlearning when browsing, whether in digital environments or in printed materials, but it is necessary to see what is being learned and sometimes interfere in this process in order to optimize or guide learning, showing users other themes, other paths, other possibilities different from those they found on their own or those they usually use. It is necessary, sometimes, to negotiate the use so that it is not exclusive, since there are other means of communication, other means of information, and other leisure alternatives. It is a matter of balancing and not blaming.

The revived world

About this house and the trees that time
forgot to take. About the stone corral
of peace and other sad cows
crying to the moon and the calfless night.
About the wide wall of this pond
where other green snakes slithered,
and putting the sun in their still eyes
they were harvesting their crop of frogs.
Under the southern constellations that the night
set and unset: the Three Marias,
the distant Southern Cross and the Big Dipper.
About this world revived in vain,
the memory of cousins, of horses,
of silence lost forever.

Garcia had approached the corpse, lifted the 
handkerchief and gazed for a few moments at the 
deceased features. Then, as if death spiritualized everything, 
he leaned over and kissed her on the forehead. It was at that moment that 
Fortunato arrived at the door. He stopped amazed; it couldn't be the kiss of friendship, it could be the epilogue of an 
adulterous book [...].

However, Garcia leaned over again to kiss the corpse, but then he couldn't anymore. The kiss burst into sobs, and the eyes couldn't contain the tears, 
which came in torrents, tears of silent love, and 
irremediable despair. Fortunato, at the door, where he stayed, 
enjoyed calmly that explosion of moral pain that was 
long, very long, delightfully long.

But as soon as we enter the web universe, we discover that it constitutes not only a vast
and rapidly expanding 'territory', but also offers numerous 'maps', filters, selections to help
the navigator to orient themselves. The best guide for the web is the web itself. Even though
it may be necessary to have the patience to explore it. Even though it may be necessary to risk
getting lost, to accept 'the loss of time' to familiarize oneself with this strange land. Perhaps
it may be necessary to yield for a moment to its playful aspect to discover, in the deviation of
a link, the sites that most closely match our professional interests or our passions and that
may, therefore, feed our personal journey in the best possible way.

Terezinha de Jesus
From a fall she went to the ground
Three gentlemen came to help
All three with their hats in hand
The first was her father
The second, her brother
The third was the one
To whom Teresa gave her hand

BATISTA, M. F. B. M.; SANTOS, I. M. F. (Org.). Songbook of Paraíba.
João Pessoa: Grafset, 1993 (adapted).

TEXT II

Another interpretation is made based on the social conditions of that time. For the nanny and for the child for whom the song was sung, the music spoke of marriage as a natural destiny in a woman's life, in the Brazilian society of the 19th century, marked by patriarchy. The music prepares the girl for her destiny not only inexorable, but desirable: marriage, establishing a hierarchy of obedience (father, older brother, husband), according to the time and circumstances of her life.

These young ladies had the habit of stating the opposite 
of what they desired. I noticed the singularity when 
they began to praise my monkey-colored jacket. They examined it seriously, found the fabric and 
trims of superior quality, the admirable tailoring. I became vain: I had never noticed such 
advantages. But the compliments continued, they brought me suspicion. I finally realized that they were mocking and 
I did not get offended. Far from it: I found curious 
that way of speaking in reverse, different from the 
rudeness to which I was accustomed. In general, they told me 
frankly that the clothes did not fit me well, they were loose under the armpits.

The Tupi language in Brazil

300 years ago, living in the village of São Paulo de Piratininga (dried fish, in Tupi) was almost synonymous with speaking the Indian language. Out of every five inhabitants of the city, only two knew Portuguese. Therefore, in 1698, the governor of the province, Artur de Sá e Meneses, begged Portugal to only send priests who knew 'the general language of the Indians', because 'those people do not explain themselves in any other language'.

Derived from the dialect of São Vicente, the Tupi of São Paulo developed and spread in the 17th century, thanks to the geographical isolation of the city and the unchristian activity of the Paulista mamelucos: the bandeiras, expeditions to the backlands in search of Indian slaves. Many bandeirantes did not even speak Portuguese or expressed themselves poorly. Domingos Jorge Velho, the Paulista who destroyed the Quilombo dos Palmares in 1694, was described by the bishop of Pernambuco as 'a barbarian who doesn't even know how to speak'. In their wanderings, these people baptized places like Avanhandava (place where the Indian runs), Pindamonhangaba (place to make a fishing hook), and Itu (waterfall). And ended up inventing a new language.
'The slaves of the bandeirantes came from more than 100 different tribes,' says historian and anthropologist John Monteiro, from the State University of Campinas. 'This changed the Paulista Tupi, which, in addition to the influence of Portuguese, also received words from other languages.' The result of the mixture became known as the general language of the south, a kind of simplified Tupi.

The reveler

When Admiral Cabral
Set foot in Brazil
The guardian angel of the Indians
Was strolling in Paris.
When he returned from his trip
The Dutchman was already here.
The angel breathes happily:
""It's okay, these are good people,
I'll air out again.""
The angel crossed the bar,
Says goodbye to Pernambuco,
Makes noise, hubbub,
Just like the zeppelin
But a wind hit the angel,
He lost his memory...
And never came back.

20,"LANGUAGES, CODES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES",2017,"One night in 67, by Renato Terra and Ricardo Calil. 
Publisher Planeta, 296 pages.

But it was a night, that Saturday night of October 21, 1967, that stopped our country. Stopped to watch the final of the III Record Festival, when a 24-year-old young man named Eduardo Lobo, Edu Lobo, left the Paramount Theater in São Paulo after winning the festival's top prize with Ponteio, which he sang accompanied by the charming and beginner Marília Medalha.

It was that night that Chico Buarque sang his Roda viva alongside MPB-4 of Magro, the arranger. That Caetano Veloso shone singing Alegria, alegria with the audience to the sound of the Beat Boys' guitars, that Gilberto Gil presented the tropicalist Domingo no parque with the Mutantes.

That night that ended up becoming a movie, in 2010, in the hands of Renato Terra and Ricardo Calil, has now become a book. The book being launched now is the story of that night, expanded and in a state that in journalistic jargon we call raw material. Those who saw the movie will delight in the stories - and some gossip - that each one has to tell, now without the necessary cuts that a movie demands. And those who did not see the movie have before them a book of stories, thinking well, of History.

Declaration of love

This is a confession of love: I love the Portuguese language. 
It is not easy. It is not malleable. [...] The Portuguese language is 
a real challenge for those who write. Especially for 
those who write, taking off the first layer of superficiality from things and people. 

Sometimes it reacts to a more complicated thought. Sometimes it is scared by the unpredictable 
of a sentence. I like to handle it - as I liked to be mounted on a horse and guide it by the reins, sometimes 
at a gallop. I wanted the Portuguese language to reach 
its maximum in my hands. And this desire is shared by all who write. A Camões and others alike were not enough 
to give us forever an inheritance of a language already made. 
All of us who write are making something that gives life to the grave of thought.

We have these difficulties. But I did not speak 
of the enchantment of dealing with a language that was not 
profound. What I inherited is not enough for me. 

If I were mute and also could not write, and 
they asked me which language I wanted to belong to, I would say: 
English, which is precise and beautiful. But, as I was not born mute and 
could write, it became absolutely clear to me 
that what I really wanted was to write in Portuguese. I even 
wished I had not learned other languages: just so that my 
approach to Portuguese would be virgin and clear.

And here, before continuing this show, it is necessary to make a warning to everyone. At this moment, we find it essential that everyone takes a defined position. Without each one taking a defined position, we cannot continue. It is essential that everyone takes a position, whether to the left or to the right. We even admit that some may take a neutral position, with their arms crossed. But it is necessary that each one, once they have taken their position, stays in it! Because otherwise, companions, the theater chairs creak a lot and no one hears anything.

Weekend at the park

Look at my people in the favelas and you will realize
From here I see a brand new car
Fully equipped and the old man driving
With his children by his side they are going to the park
Euphoric electronic toys
Automatically I imagine
The kids from the area how they are
Probably running around here and there
Playing barefoot soccer in the dirt streets
Yeah, they play the way they can
[...]
Look at that club, how cool
Look at that court, look at that field, look
Look how many people
There's an ice cream shop, cinema, hot pool
[...]
Here I don't see any sports club
No incentive for the kids to attend
The investment in leisure is very scarce
The community center is a failure

On that morning of clear sky and light air, due to the torrential rain of the previous night, I went out for a walk with the sun still hidden to take notice of the first movements of life in the countryside. It didn't take long and the intense smell of coffee brewed by Dona Linda invaded my nostrils and made hunger awaken from that lethargic state derived from the long night of sleep. I put my hands in the water that ran through the bamboo spout and the cold contact gave me goosebumps. But I went on and cupped my hands to my face. With the impact, I stepped back and momentarily lost my breath, but the awakening was immediate. Already awake, I entered the kitchen in search of quenching my hunger and getting close to the warmth of the wood stove. That's when I noticed the slender and discreet figure of a lady accompanied by a boy who seemed to be about five years old already seated at the end of the table in an intimate chat with the lady of the house. After a vigorous 'Good morning!', a warm handshake in the customary introductions, I learned that Dona Flor de Maio was taking her son Adão for treatment of the wounds that were popping up on his body, causing small pustules with reddish edges.",,"{

 Zé Araújo began to sing in a sad tone, telling 
to the curious who began to arrive that a woman 
had knelt at the feet of the holy cross and sworn in 
the name of Jesus a great love, but swore and did not fulfill, 
pretended and deceived me, you lied to me, you sinned against God, the heart has reasons that reason itself 
does not know, makes promises and vows, then forgets.

  The caboclo was sad and inspired. After this 
song that gave Neusa goosebumps, he followed with 
a waltz even more spirited, full of difficult words, 
but beautiful as only the serene drop. It was the story of a 
charming doll seen in a crystal showcase on the 
majestic pedestal. Zé Araújo closed his eyes and let 
out his voice:

Her hair had the color/ Of the sun radiating/ 
Fulvous rays of love./ Her eyes were circunvagos/
Of the blue romanticism of lakes/ Lyrical hands, some 
divine arms,/ A white body like no other/ And the feet 
very small./ Finally I saw in this doll/ A perfect 
Venus.

A kind of disgust and repulsion tinged their faces, they no longer ate with the same satisfaction and refused to praise the minced lamb pastries, the cream and date pastries, and the golden almond rice, exhaling a smell of toasted onion.

Contranarciso

in me 
I see the other
and another
and another
finally dozens
trains passing
wagons full of people
hundreds
the other
that is in me
is you
you
and you
just as
I am in you
I am in him
in us
and only when
we are in us
we are at peace
even if we are alone

The rules of Normative Grammar are based on the works of great writers, in whose language the educated classes put their ideal of perfection, because it is in it that reflects what idiomatic usage has stabilized and consecrated.

LIMA, C. H. R. Normative grammar of the Portuguese language. Rio de Janeiro: José Olympio, 1989.
TEXT II

I like to say. I will say it better: I like to word. Words are for me touchable bodies, visible sirens, incorporated sensuality. Perhaps because real sensuality has no interest for me of any kind - not even mental or dream - desire has transmuted into what creates verbal rhythms in me, or listens to them from others. I shudder if they say it well. Such a page of Fialho, such a page of Chateaubriand, make my whole life tingle in every vein, make me tremble tremulously quietly with an unattainable pleasure that I am having. Such a page, even of Vieira, in its cold perfection of syntactic engineering, makes me tremble like a branch in the wind, in a passively delirious state of moved thing.

The man said, It's raining, and then, Who are you, I'm not from here, Looking for food, Yes, we haven't eaten for four days, And how do you know it's been four days, It's a calculation, Are you alone, I'm with my husband and some companions, How many are you, In total, seven, If you're thinking of staying with us, forget it, we're already too many, We're just passing through, Where are you from, We've been quarantined since the blindness started, Oh, yes, the quarantine, it was useless, Why do you say that, They let us out, There was a fire and at that moment we realized that the soldiers who were watching us had disappeared, And they left, Yes, Your soldiers must have been among the last to go blind, everyone is blind, Everyone, the whole city, the country,

In participation sport or popular sport, the manifestation occurs in the principle of ludic pleasure, which has as its purpose the social well-being of its practitioners. It is closely associated with leisure and free time and occurs in spaces not committed to time and outside the obligations of daily life. It aims at relaxation, fun, personal development and relationship with people. It can be stated that participation sport, being the social dimension of sport most interrelated with democratic paths, balances the framework of inequalities of sports opportunities found in the performance sport dimension.

A room in the town hall. The environment is modest. 
During the mutation, a march is heard and cheers to 
Odorico, 'long live the mayor' etc. Dorotéa, Juju, Dirceu, Dulcinéa, the vicar and Odorico are on stage. The latter, at the window, gives a speech.

ODORICO - Sucupiran people! Now invested in the position of Mayor, here I am to receive the confirmation, ratification, authentication and why not say the consecration of the people who elected me.

Applause comes from outside.
ODORICO - I promised that my first act as mayor would be to order the construction of the cemetery.

Applause, which the characters on stage join.

ODORICO - (Continuing the speech:) Putting aside the meanwhiles and going to the finally, it is a joy to announce that from now on you can die peacefully, calmly and without embarrassment, knowing that you will be buried right here, in this warm and fragrant land of Sucupira. And those who voted for me, just tell the priest at the time of the last rites, that there is a burial and grave for free, as promised.

GOMES, D. The beloved. Rio de Janeiro: Ediouro, 2012.

João/Zero (Wagner Moura) is a brilliant scientist, but 
unhappy because 20 years ago he was publicly humiliated 
during a party and lost Helena (Alinne Moraes), an 
old and eternal passion. One day, an experiment with 
one of his inventions allows him to travel in 
time, returning to that time and being able to interfere 
in his destiny. But when he returns, he finds out that 
his life has completely changed and now he needs to find a way to change that story, even if he has to 
return to the past again. Will he be able to 
get things right?

Around three in the afternoon

In this cluttered room with tables, machines, and papers,
where enviable clerks shared among themselves the common sense of the world, applying clear ideas despite the noise and the heat, confident as they spoke about problems that afflict modern man (a species from which you, anciently tired, may feel somewhat excluded), suddenly drop everything under the gazes around you, compose a face of a quiet and dangerous madman, make gestures as calm as the most severe scribes, give a big 'ciao' to the day's work, as if bidding farewell to life, and surprise shortly after, with your presence at such an unusual hour, those who were at home busy cleaning the closets, which you did not know before how it was done. It is advisable not to respond to the inquisitive looks, letting the intense expectation that sets in grow for a moment. But do not overdo it and quickly go up to the room, freeing your feet from socks and shoes, taking off your clothes as if removing the importance of things, finally putting on minimal clothing, perhaps even bare, but without offending decorum (your decorum, of course), and accepting at the same time, as a good provisional truth, any change in behavior.

46,HUMANITIES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2017,"
If, then, for the things we do there is an end 
that we desire for its own sake and everything else is desired 
in the interest of that end; evidently such an end will be the good, 
or rather, the supreme good. But will not knowledge, 
perhaps, have great influence on this life? If so, 
let us strive to determine, even if only in general terms, what it is and from which of the sciences or 
faculties it constitutes the object. No one will doubt that 
its study belongs to the most prestigious art and that 
more truly can be called the master art. 
Now, politics shows to be of this nature, for it is she who 
determines which sciences should be studied 
in a State, which are those that each citizen should 
learn, and to what extent; and we see that even the most esteemed faculties, such as strategy, economics and 
rhetoric, are subject to it. Now, as politics uses 
the other sciences and, on the other hand, legislates on what 
we should and should not do, the purpose of this 
science must encompass those of the others, so that this 
purpose will be the human good.

This is about the progressive loss of productivity of entire biomes, affecting very expressive portions of the sub-humid and semi-arid domains in all hot regions of the world. It is in these ecologically transitional areas that the pressure on biomass is strongly felt, due to the removal of forest cover, overgrazing, and uncontrolled mining activities, triggering an acute environmental degradation scenario, reflected by the inability to support the development of plant species, whether a natural forest or agricultural plantations.

A society is a more or less self-sufficient association of people who in their mutual relations recognize certain rules of conduct as obligatory and who, most of the time, act accordingly. A society is well-ordered not only when it is planned to promote the well-being of its members, but also when it is effectively regulated by a public conception of justice. That is, it is a society in which everyone accepts, and knows that others accept, the same principle of justice.

The representation of Democritus is similar to that of Anaxagoras, in that an infinitely multiple is the origin; but in him the determination of the fundamental principles appears in such a way that it contains what for what it was formed is not, absolutely, the simple aspect for itself. For example, particles of flesh and gold would be principles that, through their concentration, form what appears as a figure.

A conversation of such a nature transforms the listener; Socrates' contact paralyzes and embarrasses; leads to reflect on oneself, to give attention an unusual direction: the temperamental, like Alcibiades, know that they will find with him all the good of which they are capable, but they flee because they fear this powerful influence, which leads them to blame themselves. It is especially to these young people, many almost children, that he tries to give his guidance.

The phenomenon of population mobility has been, since the last decades of the 20th century, presenting significant transformations in its behavior, not only in Brazil but also in other parts of the world. These new processes materialize, among other aspects, in the internal dimension, by redirecting migratory flows to medium-sized cities, to the detriment of large urban centers; by short-term displacements and shorter distances; by pendular movements, which become more relevant in survival strategies, no longer restricted to large urban agglomerations.

58,HUMANITIES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2017,"Palestinians gathered in front of television sets and outdoor screens in Ramallah, in the West Bank, to follow the vote on the resolution calling for the recognition of the so-called Palestine as a non-member observer State of the United Nations (UN). The goal was to wait for the birth, at least formally, of a Palestinian State. After the resolution was approved, hundreds of people went to the city square with Palestinian flags, set off fireworks, honked horns, and danced in the streets. Approved with 138 votes out of the 193 of the General Assembly, the resolution elevates the status of the Palestinian State within the organization.",,"{

62,HUMANITIES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2017,"TEXT I

Solon is the first Greek name that comes to mind when land and debt are mentioned together. Shortly after 600 BC, he was designated as a 'lawgiver' in Athens, with unprecedented powers, because the demand for land redistribution and debt cancellation could not continue to be blocked by the oligarchy of landowners through force or small concessions.

TEXT II

The 'Twelve Tables Law' became one of the fundamental texts of Roman law, one of the main Roman legacies that have reached us. The publication of these laws, around 450 BC, was important, as the knowledge of the 'rules of the game' of life in society is a favorable instrument for the common man and potentially limiting the hegemony and arbitrariness of the powerful.

With the Land Law of 1850, access to land only 
became possible through purchase with payment 
in cash. This limited, or even practically 
prevented, access to land for enslaved workers 
who gained freedom.

There are, as is known, two candidates for the presidency, 
Mr. Eduardo Gomes and Eurico Dutra, and a third, 
Mr. Getúlio Vargas, who must be a candidate of some 
hidden political group, but is also the popular candidate. 
Because there are two “we want”: the “we want” of those 
who want to see if they continue in their positions and the popular “we want”... After all, what is Mr. Getúlio Vargas? 
Is he a fascist? Is he a communist? Is he an atheist? Is he a Christian? Does he want to leave? 
Does he want to stay? However, the people seem to like him 
precisely because he is “in the style of the house”.

The popular institute, according to the examination of reason, made the figure of the ensign Xavier the main one among the conspirators, and placed his partners at half the ration of glory. Certainly deserve our esteem those others; they were patriots. But the one who offered to bear the sinners of Israel, the one who cried with joy when he saw the death penalty of his companions commuted, a penalty that was only going to be executed on him, the hanged one, the quartered one, the beheaded one, he has to receive the prize in proportion to the martyrdom, and win for all, since he paid for all.

The concept of democracy, in Habermas' thought, is built from a procedural dimension based on discourse and deliberation. Democratic legitimacy requires that the process of political decision-making occurs from a broad public discussion, only then deciding. Thus, the deliberative character corresponds to a collective process of weighing and analysis, permeated by discourse, which precedes the decision.

A person finds himself forced by necessity to borrow money. He knows very well that he will not be able to pay, but also sees that they will not lend him anything if he does not promise firmly to pay within a specified period. Feels tempted to make the promise; but still has enough conscience to ask himself: is it not forbidden and contrary to duty to get out of trouble in this way? Assuming that he decides to do so, his maxim of action would be: when I think I am in financial trouble, I will borrow it and promise to pay it back, although I know that this will never happen.

The 8.8 Richter scale earthquake that hit the west coast of Chile in February caused significant changes in the region's map. According to a preliminary analysis, the entire city of Concepción shifted at least three meters to the west. Buenos Aires moved about 2.5 centimeters to the west, while Santiago, closer to the event location, shifted almost 30 centimeters to the west-southwest. The cities of Valparaíso, in Chile, and Mendoza, in Argentina, also had their positions significantly altered (13.4 centimeters and 8.8 centimeters, respectively).

71,HUMANITIES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2017,"
The vast majority of democratic Western countries 
have adopted the Constitutional Court as a mechanism 
to control the other powers. The inclusion of the Courts 
in the political scenario implied changes in the calculation 
for the implementation of public policies. The government, 
besides negotiating its political plan with the Parliament, 
had to worry about not infringing the Constitution. 
This new institutional architecture 
has led to the development of a political environment that enabled 
the Judiciary's participation in decision-making processes.

the abbeys of the Cistercian Order, where the most rational methods of cattle breeding were used, 
certainly played a decisive role in this improvement.

The largest consumers of logistics infrastructure for export in Brazil are bulk products, among which stand out iron ore, oil and its derivatives, and soybeans, which, due to their low added value, and being moved in large volumes, require large-scale and low-cost infrastructure. In the case of soybeans, the infrastructure leaves much to be desired, resulting in huge queues of ships, trucks, and trains, which, as they remain idle in the queues for much of the time, have their costs increased, heavily burdening the exporter, affecting their profit margin and threatening our international competitiveness.

The accelerated wear and tear will always exist if the farmer does not take proper care to combat the causes, related to various processes, such as: chemical impoverishment and leaching caused by the exhaustion caused by crops and by the vertical washing of nutrients from the water that infiltrates the soil, as well as by the removal of nutritious elements with the crops. The nutrients removed, when not replaced, are commonly replaced by toxic elements, such as, for example, aluminum.

We seek to demonstrate that development can be seen as a process of expanding real freedoms that people enjoy. The focus on human freedoms contrasts with more restrictive views of development, such as those that identify development with growth of the Gross National Product, or industrialization. The growth of the GNP can be very important as a means of expanding freedoms. But freedoms also depend on other determinants, such as education and health services and civil rights.

After the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
by the UN, in 1948, Unesco published studies by 
scientists from around the world that disqualified 
racist doctrines and demonstrated the unity of the human 
species. Since then, most European scientists themselves 
have come to recognize the discriminatory nature 
of the alleged racial superiority of the white man and 
to condemn the aberrations committed in his name.

Much is said nowadays about human rights. 
Well, it was in the 18th century - in 1789, precisely - 
that a Constituent Assembly produced and proclaimed 
in Paris the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of 
the Citizen. This Declaration was imposed as necessary 
for a group of revolutionaries, as it was prepared 
for a change in the realm of ideas and mentalities: 
the Enlightenment.

Master and companion, I said we were going to say goodbye. But I said it wrong. Death does not extinguish: it transforms; it does not annihilate: it renews; it does not divorce: it brings closer. One day you supposed the consort of your dreams and agonies, who had managed to 'put a whole world in the corner' of your nest, to be 'dead and separated'; and yet, she was never more present to you, in the depths of yourself and in the expression of your song, in the depths of your being and in the face of your actions. These fourteen inimitable verses, in which the rapture of your disciples summarizes the value of a whole literature, were the golden alliance of your second engagement, a ring of other nuptials, for the new life of your rebirth and glorification, with the partner without blemish of your years of youth and maturity, of the flowering and fruition of your soul. For the chosen ones of the world of ideas, misery lies in decadence, not in death. The nobility of one preserves us from the ruins of the other. When they cross that passage from the invisible, which leads them to the region of unadulterated truth, then we begin to feel the beginning of their kingdom, the kingdom of the dead over the living.

8,"LANGUAGES, CODES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES",2023,"## Open letter to the Brazilian population
Dear Citizens,
The aging population is a worldwide phenomenon. Unfortunately, our country is not yet prepared to meet the demands of this population.
This is the picture of public health in Brazil, which, despite undeniable advances, presents a scenario of deficiencies and lack of integration at all levels of health care: primary (poor care in basic health units), secondary (lack of reference centers with specialist care) and tertiary (hospital care focused on the disease in the elderly), that is, there is no, in practice, a health care network for the elderly.
Faced with this scenario, the Brazilian Society of Geriatrics and Gerontology (SBGG) publicly expresses its concerns about the present and future of the elderly in Brazil. Health must be guaranteed as a universal right.
We hope that both our current and future leaders and legislators reflect on the need to invest in health and quality of life associated with aging. Dignity for the health of the elderly!

9,"LANGUAGES, CODES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES",2023,"The online petition created by a citizen from São Paulo had an effect: married for three years to his partner, he requested the change in the definition of 'marriage' in the traditional Michaelis dictionary in Portuguese. In the previous definition, marriage appeared as a 'legitimate union between man and woman' and a 'legal union between man and woman, to form a family'. The new entry does not mention the words man or woman at any time - now the definition of marriage refers to 'people'. According to the communication director of the website where the petition was published, the initiative shows the 'efficiency of mobilization'.

10,"LANGUAGES, CODES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES",2023,"The New Zealander Laurel Hubbard made history at the Olympic Games. Despite being out of the running for medals, the weightlifter left her mark on the Tokyo edition for being the first openly transgender woman to participate in an Olympic competition. At the beginning of her career, in the 1990s, the New Zealander competed in the men's category. In 2001, at the age of 23, she stepped away from the sport. 'The pressure of trying to fit into a world that may not have been made for people like me became too heavy a burden to bear.' In 2012, Laurel began her gender transition through hormonal therapies and, in 2013, openly declared herself a transgender woman. For the International Olympic Committee, the participation of transgender women in the Games is allowed if the testosterone level, a hormone that increases muscle mass, is below 10 nanomols per liter for at least 12 months.",,"{

The sun begins to descend behind the vegetation of Restinga Island, on the other bank of the Paraíba River, coloring the sky in yellow, orange, and lilac.

João Alphonsus
It was a black cat, as befitting a cultivator of the good letters, who had already read Poe translated by Baudelaire. Black and fat. And slow. So fat and slow that at a certain point I observed that he was completely losing the characteristic qualities of the breed, which are in short the deadly hatred of rats. He didn't even scare them away anymore! The rats of Ouro Preto are also worthy and solemn - don't laugh - traditionalists... descendants of other rats who witnessed important events of our history in those same mansions... In the townhouse of Judge Tomás Antônio Gonzaga, imagine a meeting of the dreamy conspirators, with the ancestors of those rats strolling through the attic or even through the floor among the legs of the men absorbed in the hope of national independence! And then, the ancestors of those rodents that I now saw sliding subtly in my room could have climbed up the post of colonial ignominy, where Tiradentes' head was exposed! And when the orbits were ignominiously stripped, they could even have penetrated the recesses of that skull where literature truly burned, with the simplicity of heroism, the nationalist fever...

José J. Veiga
While we were entertained by the vultures, other things were happening in the city. The Company imposed new prohibitions, some entirely silly, just for the pleasure of prohibiting (no one could spit upwards, or carry water in a calabash, or cover the sun with a sieve, as if everyone was abusing these oddities); but others were quite annoying, such as jumping over walls to take a shortcut, a tactic that almost everyone who didn't suffer from rheumatism had been adopting lately, especially the boys. And not trusting only in the prohibition, nor in the strength of the punishments, which were strict, the Company even ordered to embed glass shards in the walls. I found that to be an exaggeration, and commented on the matter with my mother. My father overheard from the room and came to explain. He said that in normal times one thing or another was enough; but now the Company could not admit any loophole in its orders; if someone disobeyed the prohibition they could cut themselves on the shards; if someone managed to jump over a wall by breaking the cut of some shards, or throwing a leather over it, they were caught by the prohibition, nhoc — and made the gesture of twisting a chicken's neck.

Something more solemn was needed,

Itamar Vieira Junior
After a long time, I decided to try to speak, because I was alone venturing into the same path that Donana used to enter. I still remember the word I chose: plow. I delighted in watching my father guiding the old farm plow carried by the ox, tearing the earth to then throw grains of rice in brown and red clods turned over. I liked the round, easy and noisy sound it had when pronounced. 'I'm going to work on the plow.' 'I'm going to plow the land.' 'It would be good to have a new plow, this plow is crooked and old.' The sound that left my mouth was an aberration, a disorder, as if there was a hot egg in place of the missing piece of the tongue. It was a crooked, deformed plow, which penetrated the earth in such a way as to leave it infertile, destroyed, torn apart. []",,"{

These boys playing shuttlecock have never seen a slave...

[...]
But their indignation can never be as great as that of those who were born and raised in full horror, in the midst of this horrible drama of blood and mud, feeling inside the ear and soul, in a dragging and continuous melody, the long moaning of the martyr race — a satanic orchestration of all the sobs, all the impressions, all the laments that torture and injustice can extract from human throats.

Of all non-loves, disaffections, marriages forever, rancors forever, of all parallels that only become viable in the abstraction of geometry, of all small passions and all great passions, of everything that stops at the antechamber of passion, of all unexperienced bonds, of all.

Conceição Evaristo
Someone had recently cut the grass, which during the rainy season grew and surrounded Ponciá Vicêncio's mother's house and Luandi's. There were also traces that the land had been turned over, as if someone was going to plant a small field there. Luandi smiled. His mother must be quite strong, as she was still working the land. He sang loudly a song he had learned from his father when they worked on the white men's land. It was a song that the older blacks taught the younger ones. They said it was a return song, which the men in Africa always sang when they were returning from fishing, hunting, or somewhere. Luandi's father, on the day he wanted to please his wife, used to sing that song as he approached home. Luandi did not understand the words of the song; however, he knew it was a language that some blacks still spoke, especially the elderly. It was a cheerful song. Luandi, besides singing, followed the rhythm by clapping his hands on an imaginary drum. He was returning to the land. He was coming home. He arrived singing, dancing the sweet and victorious return song. []",,"{

30,"LANGUAGES, CODES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES",2023,"""There are so many ways to kill a black person
That for some, their death is justified
He must have been doing something wrong
If he wasn't a criminal, he would become one day
Because he is BLACK his death is defended
The BLACK always deserves to die"".
The stanza above is from the poet and social educator Baticum Proletário, who works in the outskirts of Fortaleza, in Ceará, preparing young people - mostly black - to face the difficulties imposed by structural racism in the country.
It is through art that Baticum manages to engage youth in a project to strengthen this population by promoting rhyme battles, slams, and gatherings with themes that discuss social problems. Not surprisingly, the most explored theme in rhymes, verses, and prose is violence. According to the most recent Violence Atlas, in 2019, blacks accounted for 77 percent of homicide victims, almost 30 murders per 100,000 inhabitants, most of them young.
The Atlas also reveals that a black person is almost 2.7 times more likely to be killed than a white person, which justifies the growing resistance movement in Brazil. []",,"{

In the beginning was the Word. The sentence that opens the first chapter of the Gospel of John and refers to the creation of the world, as Genesis also does, is the most famous in the Bible. The idea that the world is created by the word, however, is so structuring that it is present in other religions, far beyond those founded in Christianity. As humans, language is the world we inhabit. Just try to imagine a world where we cannot use words to talk about ourselves and others to understand what that means. Or a world where what you say is not understood by others, and what others say is not understood by you.
What happens then when the word is destroyed and, with it, language?
For centuries, in different societies and languages, it is important to remember, language has served — and still serves — to maintain privileges of powerful groups and leave everyone else out. Who understands the language of lawyers, judges, and prosecutors, the language of doctors, the language of bureaucrats, the language of scientists? Most of the population has been subjected to the violence of being deliberately prevented from understanding the language of those who determine their destinies.
If the beginning is the Word, the end can be silence. Even if it is filled with screams among those who no longer have a common language to understand each other. []",,"{

João Guimarães Rosa
From the village of Ão, or from the nearby sites, someone urgently needed to want to come to listen to the radio soap opera. He listened to it, learned it, kept it in mind, and, returning to Ão, the next day, he repeated it to others.
So they were having dinner, the people from the village came to receive the new part of the radio soap opera. They had already heard everything once, it was out of the ordinary: the truck of a buyer of chickens and eggs had failed there in Ão the day before, Mr. Abrãozinho Buristém, who was carrying a small battery-powered radio, had set up a wire on the wire fence... But they wanted to listen again, for confirmation. - ""The story is stable and good, even though it's long: it throws and doesn't yield..."" - Zuz explained to Dalberto.
Soropita began to retell the chapter of the soap opera. Without effort, he remembered the words, even clearly - he was amazed by that. He told with pleasure to delay, to fill the room with the power of other high characters. To capture everyone's attention, he could tell that night ahead. It was necessary to bring light, some couldn't see each other anymore; when someone laughed, it was from far away. The chapter of the soap opera was ending. []",,"{

37,"LANGUAGES, CODES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES",2023,"The ashes of the National Museum, in Rio de Janeiro, consumed by the flames in September 2018, are more than just remains of fossils, ceramics, and rare specimens. The museum housed, among more than 20 million pieces, the skeletons with the answers to questions that had not yet been answered - or even asked - by Brazilian researchers. And the fire may have forever silenced ancestral indigenous words and songs, from languages that no longer exist in the world. The collection at the site contained recordings of conversations, songs, and rituals of dozens of indigenous societies, many made during the 1960s with old reel-to-reel recorders and that had not yet been digitized. Some of the records addressed already extinct languages, with no original speakers still alive. 'The hope is that other institutions have records of these languages,' says linguist Marilia Facó Soares. The researcher, who works with the Tikuna Indians, the largest group in the Brazilian Amazon, believes she has lost part of her material. 'I will have to make new field trips to rebuild my files. But obviously, it is not possible to recover the speech of deceased natives, usually the elderly,' she laments.",,"{

39,"LANGUAGES, CODES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES",2023,"If the interference of fake accounts in political discussions on social media already represented a danger to democratic systems, their sophistication and greater resemblance to real people have worsened the problem worldwide.
The danger has grown because technology and methods have evolved from robots, the 'bots' — software with automated online tasks —, to 'cyborgs' or 'trolls', accounts controlled directly by humans with the help of a little automation.
But researchers are now beginning to observe other patterns of behavior: when messages are not programmed, their publication is concentrated only during working hours, as it is controlled by people whose profession is exactly that, managing a fake profile during the day.
Another clue: the poor vocabulary of the messages published by these profiles. An employee of a company that supposedly produced and sold fake profiles explains that sometimes 'creativity was lacking' to create distinct messages while controlling so many fake profiles at the same time. []",,"{

Jarid Arraes
I have two breasts, these two thighs, two hands that are very useful to me, dark eyes, these two eyebrows that I fill in with makeup bought for nineteen and ninety and ears that do not accept jewelry. This body is a hungry, toothed, cruel, capable and violent body. I move my arms and crowds run desperate. I walk in the dark with my face down, because each isolated part of me has its own life and I do not want to tame them. Animal of the caatinga. Too strong. Swallower of swords and thorns.
They say and I heard, but then I also read, that the state of Ceará abolished slavery four years before the rest of the country. All those bodies that were brought with their fingers counted, their heels ready and their navels on fire, all of them were interrupted at the port. A man — they say and I heard and then I also read — led the uprising. And all these bodies went to seek other discomforts. They went to be bothered. []",,"{

A small Brazilian publisher, Urutau, has just launched in Lisbon an “anti-racist anthology of foreign poets in Portugal”, entitled Go back to your land.
The book denounces the various forms of racism to which immigrants are subjected. Some of the Brazilian poets anthologized complain about the disdain with which a large number of Portuguese people welcome Brazilian Portuguese. It is a common complaint.
“Here in Portugal they say / - they say - / that our Portuguese is wrong, that we do not speak Portuguese”, writes the São Paulo poet Maria Giulia Pinheiro, to conclude: “If your language, the Lusitanian one, / still retains the word of oppression / it is not the most beautiful in the world./ It is one of the most violent.” []",,"{

Even that time I could see the bizarreness of the customs that constituted the more or less constant laws of his world: as I approached, I verified that Mr. Timóteo, fat and sweaty, wore a dress with fringes and sequins that had belonged to his mother. The bodice descended excessively tight at the waist, and here and there a little of the imprisoned flesh burst through the seam, fraying the fabric and making the pleasure of dressing in that way a true kind of torment. He moved slowly, swaying all his fringes and vigorously fanning himself with one of those sandalwood wooden fans, which enveloped him in a nauseating wave of perfume. I don't know exactly what he had put on his head, it looked more like a turban or a hat without brims from which vigorous strands of blond hair emerged. As was also his custom, he wore makeup on his face — and for this, as well as for his clothing, he had taken over all the wardrobe left by his mother, also in her time famous for the extravagance with which she dressed — which undoubtedly made his huge nose stand out, so characteristic of the Meneses family.

Mário de Andrade

What slow circles in the pond where a free wing grazed...

The third was the rich lady,

Room of Junk: Diary of a Slumdweller
Carolina Maria de Jesus
How horrible it is to see a child eating and asking: 'Is there more?' This word 'more' keeps oscillating inside the brain of a mother who looks at the pots and there is no more.
## TEXT 2
The experience of seeing hungry children in the 1950s, described by Carolina, is experienced in Brazil in 2021 by a resident of Petrolândia, in Pernambuco. 'I used to work as a hairdresser's assistant, but the girl who had the salon closed. I was supporting myself with the aid I had, but now I was not included. Sometimes people help me with food for my children. Occasionally, I find some odd job to do, but it's very rare. There are days when I don't even have my baby's milk.' []",,"{

49,HUMANITIES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"They were pioneers of women's rights in Afghanistan. Fierce defenders of the law, they sought justice for the most marginalized. But now, more than 220 Afghan female judges are in hiding out of fear of retaliation under the Taliban regime. One of them sentenced hundreds of men for violence against women, including rape, murder, and torture. But a few days after the Taliban took control of their city and thousands of convicted criminals were released from prison, death threats began. The country has always been considered one of the most difficult and dangerous places in the world for women.

51,HUMANITIES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"## Interdisciplinary studies broaden knowledge about chinesice in the baroque of Minas Gerais
Silk, aromatic woods and textiles, works of art, wool, crystals and many, many pieces of porcelain arrived in Brazil during the 17th and 18th centuries. The opulence provided by gold made these items even more present in mining cities such as Ouro Preto, Mariana and Sabará. These objects inspired the creation of chinesices, a term that designates a type of art that evokes Chinese motifs, present in various baroque churches in Minas Gerais. In Brazil, it is very likely that the inspiration for the paintings in baroque churches with birds, elephants, tigers, mandarins and pagodas was taken from engravings, fabrics, furniture and, mainly, from Chinese porcelain that circulated freely in a society enriched by the trade of gold and gemstones.

With a population of 25 million inhabitants (about 60 percent of Muslim minorities, mainly of Uighur ethnicity), Xinjiang is a strategic region for China. It borders eight countries, is a crucial artery of the Chinese Belt and Road mega-infrastructure project, and has the largest national reserves of coal and natural gas.
## TEXT 2
Among the provinces of the Western Region, Xinjiang stands out by receiving more than 1.7 million migrants between 2000 and 2010. The main reason for this migratory flow is that the government provides subsidies to the population aiming to increase the proportion of Han Chinese in relation to the local population of Turkish and Muslim ethnicities.

The pessimist
Gabriel García Márquez
Gerineldo sleeps because he is already resigned to his world. Because he already knows everything that can happen to him after subjecting all the objects around him to a meticulous inventory of possibilities. His apartment, more than an apartment, is a theory of luck and misfortune. Better than anyone, Gerineldo knows the coefficient of expansion of his windows and keeps marked on the thermometer, with a red line, the point at which the glass will break, shattered into shards of death. He knows that architects and engineers have already predicted everything, except what has never happened before.
## TEXT 2
Being and Nothingness: An Essay on Phenomenological Ontology
Jean-Paul Sartre
The situation is the whole subject (he is nothing but his situation) and is also the whole thing (there is never anything but things). It is the subject elucidating things by its own overcoming, if we wish; or it is things sending back to the subject his image. It is total facticity, the absolute contingency of the world, of my birth, of my place, of my past, of my surroundings - and it is my limitless freedom that makes facticity exist for me. []",,"{

Honoré de Balzac
During the French Revolution, a certain priest Niollant hid in the small castle of L’Escarbas. He paid generously for the hospitality of the old nobleman by taking care of his daughter's education, Anaïs. The presence of the mother did not change this masculine education given to a young creature already very inclined to independence due to life in the countryside. The priest passed on to the student his fearlessness of opinions and his ease of judgment, without thinking that these qualities, so necessary in a man, become defects in a woman destined for the humble tasks of a family mother. Although the priest continually recommended to the student to be as graceful and modest as her knowledge was extensive, Miss de Nègrepelisse had an excellent opinion of herself. []",,"{

Like thousands of Jews from Eastern Europe, her coming to Brazil occurred at a time of rising anti-Semitism in Europe that made their lives precarious. Brazil presented itself as a possibility in the search for survival and development.
## TEXT 2
The Jewish presence in Brazil gradually created certain suspicions that were reflected in the press and in intellectual and political circles. In part, this negative image would stem from the nationalist wave that emerged in the late 1910s, which saw immigrants as competitors to Brazilian workers, or as unproductive beings, exploiters of labor and native wealth. In addition, the political elites of the time believed that foreigners carried anarchist and communist doctrines, alien to the “Brazilian people's character”. These “undesirables” would be an external evil that would corrupt the nation. []",,"{

Michel Foucault
The economy of illegalities has been restructured with the development of capitalist society. The illegality of goods has been separated from the illegality of rights. A division that corresponds to a class opposition, because, on one hand, the illegality more accessible to the popular classes will be that of goods - violent transfer of properties; on the other hand, to the bourgeoisie, then, will be reserved the illegality of rights: the possibility of diverting their own regulations and their own laws; and this great redistribution of illegalities will even be translated by a specialization of judicial circuits; for the illegalities of goods - for theft - ordinary courts and punishments; for the illegalities of rights - fraud, tax evasion, irregular commercial operations - special jurisdictions with transactions, accommodations, mitigated fines etc. []",,"{

79,HUMANITIES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"From the 1930s onwards, the principles of work rationalization began to be discussed in Brazil. Concerns about the kitchen and domestic work were introduced with sanitary medicine and the supply of gas and electricity for domestic use in the early 20th century. The organization of the kitchen aimed to achieve a simplification of tasks, with movement economy, and the cheapening of equipment, based on large-scale production. The standardization and rationalization of housing and its components aimed at a radical transformation of the house, especially the kitchen, and relied on both the development of new equipment and studies on the rationalization of domestic work. The main concern was the development of a new type of housing, which should induce a new social behavior. []",,"{

87,HUMANITIES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"The Cavalgada de Sant'Ana is an expression of the devotion of the cowboys to the patron saint of Caicó (RN). From the 1950s to the 1970s, this event, then called Cavalaria, was celebrated by people living in the rural area of the municipality of Caicó. These people used animals (donkeys, mules, and horses) as their only means of transportation, especially to go to the city on market days, bringing their products to sell. Being in Caicó during the Feast of Sant'Ana, these farmers organized a cavalcade to the courtyard of the Cathedral of Sant'Ana to praise the saint and receive blessings for their animals. Around the 1970s, with the arrival of cars in the rural area of the municipality, this cultural expression was extinguished. The means of transportation using animals began to be replaced by cars, especially pickups and trucks, which transported the peasants to the city on market days and festivals. Since 2002, a group of people from Caicó has resumed this cultural expression and, together with the cowboys' association, holds the Cavalgada de Sant'Ana on the first Sunday of the Feast. The event, in addition to the participation of riders living in rural areas, also attracts people living in Caicó, neighboring cities, and fans of rodeos.",,"{

88,HUMANITIES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"From the 16th century onwards, at least in the upper classes, the fork began to be used as an eating utensil, coming through Italy first to France and then to England and Germany, after having served, for some time, only to remove solid foods from the platter. Henry III introduced it in France, probably bringing it from Venice. His courtiers were not a little ridiculed for this 'affected' way of eating and, at first, were not very skilled in the use of the utensil: at least it was said that half of the food fell from the fork on the way from the plate to the mouth. As recently as the 17th century, the fork was still basically a luxury item, usually made of silver or gold.",,"{

99,NATURAL SCIENCES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"## Parents with Down syndrome
### Three years after giving birth, mother with Down syndrome reveals details of her daily life
Down syndrome is a genetic alteration associated with trisomy of chromosome 21, that is, the individual has three chromosome 21 instead of a pair, as is normal. This occurs due to the union of a gamete containing one chromosome 21 with a gamete containing two chromosome 21. Although women with the syndrome are usually sterile, in 2008, in the countryside of São Paulo, one of them gave birth to a girl without Down syndrome.
Knowing this, a young couple, both with this syndrome, seek a specialist doctor for genetic counseling because they want to have a baby. []",,"{

102,NATURAL SCIENCES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"Scientists can determine the age of a fossil with less than 40,000 years old using the carbon-14 or radioactive carbon method. This is done based on the relationship between the remaining carbon-14 in the fossil and the amount of carbon-14 in a similar current species. Despite undergoing radioactive decay, the amount of carbon-14 in the atmosphere, particularly in CO2 molecules, is practically constant, due to the incidence of cosmic rays that reach the Earth at all times. Thus, as part of the carbon cycle, animals and plants maintain a practically constant amount of carbon-14 in their constitution while they are alive. However, when they die, the entry of carbon into the organism ceases and this number decreases as carbon-14 decays radioactively. The half-life of carbon-14, that is, the time required for half of the radioactive atoms in a sample to decay, is constant and approximately 5,730 years.",,"{

107,NATURAL SCIENCES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"## Urban cleaning booklet
According to the Federal Constitution, it is the responsibility of municipalities to manage urban cleaning and waste collection services (garbage). However, there are reports that part of this garbage ends up being incinerated, releasing toxic substances into the environment and causing accidents by explosions, especially when aerosol bottles are incinerated (for example: deodorants, insecticides, and repellents). The high temperature causes the vaporization of all the contents inside this type of bottle, increasing the pressure inside it until culminating in the explosion of the packaging.
Suppose a metallic aerosol bottle with a capacity of 100 milliliters, containing 0.1 mol of gaseous products at a temperature of 650 degrees Celsius at the time of the explosion.

112,NATURAL SCIENCES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"## The aircraft crew member and ionizing radiation
Cosmic rays are sources of ionizing radiation potentially dangerous to the human body. To quantify the dose of radiation received, the sievert is used, defined as the unit of energy received per unit of mass. Exposure to radiation from cosmic rays increases with altitude, which can pose a problem for aircraft crews. Recently, accurate measurements of ionizing radiation doses were taken for flights between Rio de Janeiro and Rome. The results have indicated that the average dose of radiation received during the cruise phase (which usually represents 80 percent of the total flight time) of this intercontinental route is 2 microsieverts per hour. International civil aviation standards limit the working time for crews operating on intercontinental flights to 1,000 hours per year. Consider that the dose of ionizing radiation for a chest X-ray is estimated at 0.2 millisieverts. []",,"{

115,NATURAL SCIENCES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"Digital information - data - is recorded on optical discs, such as CD and DVD, in the form of microscopic cavities. The recording and optical reading of this information are performed by a laser (source of monochromatic light). The smaller the dimensions of these cavities, the more data is stored in the same area of the disc. The limiting factor for data reading is the scattering of light by the diffraction effect, a phenomenon that occurs when light passes through an obstacle with dimensions on the order of its wavelength. This limitation motivated the development of lasers with emission at shorter wavelengths, enabling the storage and reading of data in increasingly smaller cavities.",,"{

124,NATURAL SCIENCES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"## Update of the recommendation of the Portuguese Society of Neonatology
The glass containing aluminum in its composition is an excellent material for storing medications and supplements, as it can be sterilized by heating. However, when the medication or supplement contains substances that strongly bind to the ion of this metal, the dissolution of aluminum is promoted due to the displacement of the chemical equilibrium established between the species immobilized in the glass and the species in solution. For this reason, it is recommended that newborn nutrition supplements containing calcium gluconate be stored in plastic packaging, and not in this type of glass. []",,"{

152,MATHEMATICS AND ITS TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"Aiming to attract more customers, the manager of a store announced a promotion in which each customer who makes a purchase can win a voucher to be used on their next purchase. To win their voucher, the customer needs to randomly draw a ball from each of the two urns A and B made available by the manager, in which there are only black and white balls. Currently, the probability of randomly choosing a black ball in urn A is 20 percent and the probability of choosing a black ball in urn B is 25 percent. The customer who draws two black balls, one from each urn, wins the voucher. Over the days, the manager realized that, for the promotion to be viable for the business, it was necessary to change the customer's success probability without changing the promotion rule. To do this, he decided to change the number of white balls in urn B so that the probability of a customer winning the voucher would be less than or equal to 1 percent. It is known that urn B has 4 black balls and that, in both urns, all balls have the same probability of being drawn.",,"{

160,MATHEMATICS AND ITS TECHNOLOGIES,2023,"A fisherman has a daily fixed cost of 900 reais with fuel, bait, boat maintenance, and other small expenses. He sells each kilogram of fish for 5 reais. His goal is to make a minimum profit of 800 reais per day. Alone, he can, at the end of a day's work, catch 180 kilograms of fish, which is just enough to cover the daily fixed cost. Therefore, he needs to hire helpers, paying each one 250 reais per day of work. In addition to this amount, 4 percent of the revenue obtained from selling fish is equally divided among the helpers. Considering the size of his boat, he can hire up to 5 helpers. He knows that with one helper, the daily fishing is 300 kilograms and that, from the second hired helper onwards, the amount of fish caught per helper in a day's work increases by 100 kilograms.",,"{
