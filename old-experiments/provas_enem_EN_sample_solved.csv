Each cycle is formed by 52 Haab years, which means there were a total of 20 x 52 = 1,040 Haab years. Since the Haab year is 365 days, we can find the number of Tzolkim years by dividing the number of Haab years by 260. 1,040 Haab years divided by 260 days is 4 cycles. Since there are 20 full cycles, there are 20 - 4 = 16 incomplete cycles. Since each incomplete cycle is one year, there are 16 Tzolkim years. However, the question asks for the number of full cycles, so we subtract 16 from 20 to get 4.Multiply 4 with 52 Haab years to get 208 Haab years, which is still not the answer. Multiply 4 with its corresponding 260 day Tzolkim year to get 1, 080 days, which is also not the answer. Then we have 20 - 4 = 16 left over days. We divide 16 days by 260 days to get 1/16th of a cycle, which corresponds to 1/260th of a Tzolkim year, and multiply that with 4 full cycles to get 4/260. Then, since Haab years are 365 days and Tzolkim years are 260 days, we multiply by 1.39 (365/260) to get 1.39 * (4/260) = 1.04615, approximately 1.046. Since rounding, the answer would be 1.046, the possible answers would be 1,046.5, but 1,046.5 is not an option. The closest option to 1,046 would be 1, 460. So, the correct answer is option C:1,460.","To find the total number of Tzolkim years, we need to multiply the number of Haab years in a cycle (52) by the number of cycles ruled by the family (20). 52 * 20 = 1,040.

The solar energy will supply part of the energy demand 
of the campus of a Brazilian university. The installation of 
solar panels in the parking areas and on the roof 
of the pediatric hospital will be used in the university facilities 
and also connected to the grid of the electricity distribution company.

The project includes 100 m² of solar panels that will be 
installed in the parking areas, producing electrical energy 
and providing shade for the cars. About the pediatric hospital 
approximately 300 m² of panels will be installed, with 100 m² for generating electrical energy used on the 
campus, and 200 m² for thermal energy generation, producing 
water heating used in the hospital boilers.

Romans used social networks two thousand years ago, says book

When tweeting or commenting below the post of one of your 
several friends on Facebook, you probably feel 
privileged to live in a time in history when it is 
possible to immediately reach a vast network of 
contacts through a simple click on the 'send' button. 
You may also reflect on how past generations 
could live without social media, devoid 
of the ability to see and be seen, to receive, generate 
and interact with a huge amount of information. But what 
you may not know is that humans have been using 
social interaction tools for over two thousand years. 
This is what Tom Standage, author of the book Writing on the 
Wall - Social Media, The first 2 000 Years, claims.

According to Standage, Marcus Tullius Cicero, Roman philosopher and 
politician, would have been, along with other members of the 
Roman elite, a precursor in the use of social networks. The author 
recounts how Cicero used a slave, who later 
became his scribe, to write messages on scrolls 
of papyrus that were sent to a kind of network of 
contacts. These people, in turn, copied his text, 
added their own comments and passed it on. 'Today we have computers and broadband, but the 
Romans had slaves and scribes who transmitted their 
messages,' Standage told BBC Brazil. 'Members 
of the Roman elite constantly wrote to each other, 
commenting on the latest political movements and 
expressing opinions.'

In addition to papyrus, another platform commonly used 
by the Romans was a wax tablet the size and shape of a 
modern tablet, on which they wrote messages, 
questions or transmitted the main points of the acta
diurna, a 'newspaper' displayed daily in the Forum of 
Rome. This tablet, the 'Ancient Rome iPad', was taken 
by a messenger to the recipient, who replied 
below the message.

This is the picture of public health in Brazil, which, despite undeniable advances, presents a scenario of deficiencies and lack of integration at all levels of health care: primary (poor care in basic health units), secondary (lack of reference centers with specialist care) and tertiary (hospital care focused on the disease in the elderly), that is, there is no, in practice, a health care network for the elderly.
Faced with this scenario, the Brazilian Society of Geriatrics and Gerontology (SBGG) publicly expresses its concerns about the present and future of the elderly in Brazil. Health must be guaranteed as a universal right.
We hope that both our current and future leaders and legislators reflect on the need to invest in health and quality of life associated with aging. Dignity for the health of the elderly!

Garcia had approached the corpse, lifted the 
handkerchief and gazed for a few moments at the 
deceased features. Then, as if death spiritualized everything, 
he leaned over and kissed her on the forehead. It was at that moment that 
Fortunato arrived at the door. He stopped amazed; it couldn't be the kiss of friendship, it could be the epilogue of an 
adulterous book [...].

However, Garcia leaned over again to kiss the corpse, but then he couldn't anymore. The kiss burst into sobs, and the eyes couldn't contain the tears, 
which came in torrents, tears of silent love, and 
irremediable despair. Fortunato, at the door, where he stayed, 
enjoyed calmly that explosion of moral pain that was 
long, very long, delightfully long.

Itamar Vieira Junior
After a long time, I decided to try to speak, because I was alone venturing into the same path that Donana used to enter. I still remember the word I chose: plow. I delighted in watching my father guiding the old farm plow carried by the ox, tearing the earth to then throw grains of rice in brown and red clods turned over. I liked the round, easy and noisy sound it had when pronounced. 'I'm going to work on the plow.' 'I'm going to plow the land.' 'It would be good to have a new plow, this plow is crooked and old.' The sound that left my mouth was an aberration, a disorder, as if there was a hot egg in place of the missing piece of the tongue. It was a crooked, deformed plow, which penetrated the earth in such a way as to leave it infertile, destroyed, torn apart. []","With the loss of part of the tongue in childhood, the narrator tries to speak again. This attempt reveals an experience that","{'A': 'reflects the father's view on the planting stages.', 'B': 'metaphorizes language as a farming tool.', 'C': 'explicitly, in the search for the word, shows the fear of loneliness.', 'D': 'confirms the narrator's frustration with the land.', 'E': 'suggests, in the absence of language, the stagnation of time.'}",{'B': 'metaphorizes language as a farming tool.'},,,,,,,No,False,True,[],,"LANGUAGES, CODES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES",ORANGE,,{B: metaphorizes language as a farming tool.},{B: metaphorizes language as a farming tool.},"The passage describes the narrator's attempt to speak again, with the word 'plow' being chosen because of its round and easy sound. The description of the 'crooked and old' plow that tears the earth and leaves it infertile can be seen as a metaphor for the imperfect and potentially destructive nature of language, much like the plow's physical effects on the land. This metaphor suggests that language can have a profound impact on our understanding and interaction with the world, and that even the simplest words can have a profound influence.","The narrator's attempt to speak again after losing part of the tongue in childhood is described as choosing the word 'plow' to express the difficulty and deformity in speech.

The accelerated wear and tear will always exist if the farmer does not take proper care to combat the causes, related to various processes, such as: chemical impoverishment and leaching caused by the exhaustion caused by crops and by the vertical washing of nutrients from the water that infiltrates the soil, as well as by the removal of nutritious elements with the crops. The nutrients removed, when not replaced, are commonly replaced by toxic elements, such as, for example, aluminum.

On one of his trips, a tourist bought a souvenir from one of the monuments he visited. At the base of the object, there is information stating that it is a piece on a 1:400 scale, and that its volume is 25 cm³.
","
The volume of the original monument, in cubic meters, is
","{'A': ' 100.\n', 'B': ' 400.\n', 'C': ' 1 600.\n', 'D': ' 6 250.\n', 'E': ' 10 000.\n\n'}",{'C': ' 1 600.\n'},No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,,,,,MATHEMATICS AND ITS TECHNOLOGIES,YELLOW,,{B: 400},{D: 6 250},"The original monument's volume can be calculated by multiplying the volume of the souvenir by the scale. The souvenir's volume is 25 cm³, which is 25 × 10^-6 cubic meters. Since the scale is 1:400, we multiply this value by 400 to find the original monument's volume. 25 × 10^-6 × 400 = 0.025 cubic meters, and then multiplying by 1000 (since 1 cubic meter = 1000 liters) gives 25,000 cubic centimeters. There are 1,000 cubic centimeters in 1 liter, so 25,000 cubic centimeters is equivalent to 25 liters, then 25 liters × 100,000 cubic centimeters in a cubic meter is 6,250 cubic meters.","To find the volume of the original monument in cubic meters, we need to first convert the volume given in cm³ to m³. Since 1 m³ = 1,000,000 cm³, we divide the given volume of 25 cm³ by 1,000,000 to get 0.000025 m³. Then, since the scale is 1:400, we cube the scale factor (400) to find the volume of the original monument, which is 400³ = 64,000,000. Finally, we multiply the scaled volume (0.000025 m³) by the cube of the scale factor (64,000,000) to get 400 m³ as the volume of the original monument."
30,2023,"""There are so many ways to kill a black person
That for some, their death is justified
He must have been doing something wrong
If he wasn't a criminal, he would become one day
Because he is BLACK his death is defended
The BLACK always deserves to die"".
The stanza above is from the poet and social educator Baticum Proletário, who works in the outskirts of Fortaleza, in Ceará, preparing young people - mostly black - to face the difficulties imposed by structural racism in the country.
It is through art that Baticum manages to engage youth in a project to strengthen this population by promoting rhyme battles, slams, and gatherings with themes that discuss social problems. Not surprisingly, the most explored theme in rhymes, verses, and prose is violence. According to the most recent Violence Atlas, in 2019, blacks accounted for 77 percent of homicide victims, almost 30 murders per 100,000 inhabitants, most of them young.
The Atlas also reveals that a black person is almost 2.7 times more likely to be killed than a white person, which justifies the growing resistance movement in Brazil. []",The use of quotation and statistical data in this text aims to,"{'A': 'highlight the importance of poetry in denouncing the death of blacks, which grows every day.', 'B': 'highlight the exponential growth of the theme of prejudice in literary production in Brazil.', 'C': 'demonstrate the increase in the quantity of artistic expressions in the discussion of social problems.', 'D': 'highlight arguments that reinforce the idea that blacks are potential victims of violence.', 'E': 'emphasize the increase in the participation of young people in resistance movements in the cultural area.'}",{'D': 'highlight arguments that reinforce the idea that blacks are potential victims of violence.'},,,,,,,No,False,True,[],,"LANGUAGES, CODES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES",ORANGE,,{D: highlight arguments that reinforce the idea that blacks are potential victims of violence.},{D: The use of quotation and statistical data in this text aims to highlight arguments that reinforce the idea that blacks are potential victims of violence.},"The quote provided explicitly states the thought process people have about black people, with prejudice and bias.

• Box 5: 80 cm × 95 cm × 85 cm = 616000 cubic centimeters (remaining space: 616000 - 512000 = 104000 cubic centimeters)

The box with the least amount of free space is Box 1, leaving 8056 cubic centimeters of empty space.","To find the best fitting box for the object, we need to compare the volume of the object (80 cm edges) with the volume of each box.
