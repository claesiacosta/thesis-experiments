The waters are red, the rivers, as if someone

TEXT I

Our fight is for the democratization of land ownership, increasingly concentrated in our country. About 1% of all landowners control 46% of the land. We exert pressure through the occupation of unproductive large estates and properties that do not fulfill their social function, as determined by the 1988 Constitution. We also occupy farms that have their origins in the illegal occupation of public lands.

The small rural landowner is similar to a small shop owner: the smaller the business, the harder it is to maintain, as it must be productive and the burdens are difficult to bear.

Females of some species of spiders, scorpions, and other invertebrates prey on males after copulation and insemination. For example, cannibal females of the insect known as praying mantis, Tenodera aridofolia, have up to 63% of their diet composed of male partners. For females, sexual cannibalism can ensure the acquisition of important nutrients in reproduction. With this increase in the diet, they generally produce a greater quantity of eggs.

The production of steel involves heating iron ore, along with coal (carbon) and atmospheric air in a series of redox reactions. The product is called pig iron and contains about 3.3% carbon. One way to eliminate excess carbon 
is through oxidation from heating pig iron with pure oxygen gas. The two main products formed are mild steel (an iron alloy with a remaining carbon content of 0.3%) and carbon dioxide. The approximate molar masses of the elements carbon and oxygen are, 
respectively, 12 g/mol and 16 g/mol.

Teenagers: taller, fatter, and lazier
The offer of industrialized products and the lack of time have their share of responsibility for the increase in the silhouette of young people. 'Our eating habits, in general, have changed a lot,' observes Vivian Ellinger, president of the Brazilian Society of Endocrinology and Metabolism (SBEM), in Rio de Janeiro. Research shows that here in Brazil, we are overdoing salt and sugar, as well as consuming little milk and eating fewer fruits and beans.

Another sin, a well-known one for those who display excess fat due to gluttony, emerges as a mark of the new generation: laziness. 'One hundred percent of the girls participating in the Program did not practice any sports,' reveals psychologist Cristina Freire, who monitors the emotional development of the volunteers.

You probably already know what the consequences are of a sedentary routine full of fat. 'And it's no news that obese people have a shorter lifespan,' believes Claudia Cozer, endocrinologist of the Brazilian Association for the Study of Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome. But, if five years ago studies projected a bleak future for young people, in the current scenario, the diseases that would come in old age are already part of their routine.

Teenagers: taller, fatter and lazier
The offer of industrialized products and the lack of time have their share of responsibility for the increase in the silhouette of young people. 'Our eating habits, in general, have changed a lot,' observes Vivian Ellinger, president of the Brazilian Society of Endocrinology and Metabolism (SBEM), in Rio de Janeiro. Research shows that here in Brazil, we are overdoing salt and sugar, as well as consuming little milk and eating fewer fruits and beans.

Another sin, a well-known one for those who exhibit excess fat due to gluttony, emerges as a mark of the new generation: laziness. 'One hundred percent of the girls participating in the Program did not practice any sports,' reveals psychologist Cristina Freire, who monitors the emotional development of the volunteers.

You probably already know what the consequences are of a sedentary routine full of fat. 'And it's no news that obese people have a shorter lifespan,' believes Claudia Cozer, endocrinologist at the Brazilian Association for the Study of Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome. But, if five years ago studies projected a bleak future for young people, in the current scenario the diseases that would come in old age are already part of their routine. 'Teenagers are already suffering from hypertension and diabetes,' Claudia exemplifies.

New technologies

Currently, there is a prevailing discourse in the media about the exaltation of new technologies, especially those related to telecommunications. Common expressions such as 'the future has already arrived', 'technological wonders' and 'total connection with the world' 'fetishize' new products, turning them into objects of desire, of mandatory consumption. For this reason, today we carry in our pockets, bags, and backpacks the so-celebrated 'future'. However, we cannot reduce ourselves to mere victims of a perverse media apparatus, or of a controlling capitalist apparatus. There is perversion, certainly, and control, without a doubt. Nevertheless, we have developed a symbiotic relationship of mutual dependence with the media vehicles, which tightens with each shared image and with each personal dossier transformed into a public object of entertainment.

No longer like those chained in Plato's cave, we are free to imprison ourselves, by spontaneous will, in this sadomasochistic relationship with the media structures, in which we both control and are controlled.

With a lot of faith and little struggle 
Get up, you have a lot of protests to make 
And a lot of strikes, you can, you must, believe me 
There's no use looking at the ground 
Turning your face away not to see 
Pay attention, they put you on a cross and just because Jesus 
Suffered doesn't mean you have to suffer!

Specific to June festivities, the quadrilha originated as an aristocratic dance, originating from French salons, later spread throughout Europe.

In Brazil, it was introduced as a ballroom dance and, in turn, appropriated and adapted by popular taste. For its occurrence, the presence of a 'remarkable' or 'marker' master is important, as they are the ones who determine the various figures that the dancers perform. The following markings are observed consistently: 'Tour', 'En avant', 'Chez des dames', 'Chez des chevaliê', 'Cestinha de flor', 'Balancê', 'Caminho da roça', 'Olha a chuva', 'Garranchê', 'Passeio', 'Coroa de flores', 'Coroa de espinhos', etc.

Arguing is not winning a discussion at any cost. Convincing someone of something is, first and foremost, an alternative to the practice of winning an issue by shouting or physical violence - or non-physical. Non-physical, colon. A politician who blatantly lies can captivate voters. An advertisement that stoops low can embarrass crowds into consuming a harmful product to the environment. There are psychological manipulations not only in religion. And it is common for people to act emotionally, because they are victims of cunning - and neck-hugging - seduction. Although effectiveness at all costs is not arguing, nor is it about admitting only scientific truths - forming an opinion only after seeing the demonstration and evidence, as science does. Arguing is a matter of everyday life, a form of rhetoric, but it is a reasoning that tries to convince without becoming mere manipulative calculation, and it can be rigorous without being scientific.

It is evident that vitamin D is important — but how to obtain it? Really, vitamin D can be naturally produced by exposure to sunlight, but it also exists in some common foods.

We all know that vitamin D (cholecalciferol) is crucial for your health. But is vitamin D really a vitamin? Is it present in the foods that humans normally consume? Although it exists to some extent in fish fat, vitamin D is not in our diets, unless humans artificially enhance a food product, such as vitamin D enriched milk. Nature intended for you to produce it in your skin, not to put it directly in your mouth.

Chapter LIV - The pendulum

I left there savoring the kiss. I couldn't sleep; I lay down in bed, it's true, but it was the same as nothing. I heard 
all the hours of the night. Usually, when I lost sleep, the ticking of the pendulum made me very uncomfortable; that 
somber, slow, and dry tick-tock seemed to say with each 
strike that I was going to have one less moment of life. I imagined then an old devil, sitting between two bags, one of life 
and one of death, and counting them like this:

- Another one less...
- Another one less...
- Another one less...
- Another one less...
The most peculiar thing is that, if the clock stopped, I would wind it up, so that it would never stop ticking, and I could count all my lost moments. There are inventions that change or end; the same institutions die; the clock is definitive and 
perpetual. The last man, bidding farewell to the cold and worn-out sun, must have a clock in his pocket, to know the exact 
time of his death.
That night I did not suffer from that sad feeling of 
boredom, but another, and delightful. Fantasies were tumultuous inside me, they came one after another, like devotees jostling to see the angel-singer of processions. I did not hear the lost moments, but the gained minutes.

American journalist Nicholas Carr believes that the

explains scientific discoveries about the functioning of the
human brain and theorizes about the influence of the internet

information to another, the more money
internet companies make,' he evaluates.

MATHEMATICS AND ITS TECHNOLOGIES,2013,"
The ceramic is a very present artifact in the history of humanity. One of its several properties is the shrinkage (contraction), which consists in the evaporation of the water existing in a ceramic set or block when subjected to a certain high temperature. This temperature elevation, which occurs during the cooking process, causes a reduction of up to 20% in the linear dimensions of a piece.

After a 20% reduction in each side, the new dimensions become 24 cm and 12 cm. Therefore, the new area is 24 cm * 12 cm = 288 cm². However, since the reduction applies to both dimensions, we need to consider the total reduction in area: 450 cm² - 288 cm² = 162 cm².
